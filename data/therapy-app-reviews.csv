My therapist sent me one text a day, asking for clarification on things I went into extreme detail about. Then she wouldn’t do anything with the extra information I gave her. She just moved on. I expressed frustration, but she made it seem like it was my fault, so I dropped it.

About two weeks I asked her to hold me accountable with some goals. I figure if she’s only gonna text me once, she can at least check to make sure I’m doing what I want to be doing, but she didn’t. She didn’t check on me for a week. And I really needed help during that week. What could have been a small conversation turned into me staying inside for 4 days.

This past week (our final week together), we’ve mostly been trying to schedule a video call because she has a different schedule than what’s on Talkspace and many in person clients who are clearly the priority. However, we weren’t able to figure it out and now I won’t get to use it. 

Additionally she never talked about making a plan based on what I told her. We never went over any assessments. (Besides her literally reading the results. I know what the answers say I wrote them.) Nor did we talk about the Talkspace program itself. So it looks like there are a lot of really cool features that I missed out on.

Ironic for a mental-health app. 

Pros:

- My therapist was great. :)
- You get a selection of therapists that you can choose from
- You can dispute it with your bank for a refund, so that was nice!

Cons:

- I paid on August 28th for my September therapy sessions. I e-mailed in on August 29th to cancel my membership. Per my e-mail, I stated, “I understand that this month has already been paid for as I would like to finish up my therapy sessions for this month.” The Employee responded with, “I would advise to request your cancellation by 9 am PT one business day before your next scheduled billing date to cancel your account as we have no way to have it set to cancel at a specific date.” 

I understand there’s no way to set a specific date to cancel, so I requested to cancel asap as it’s understandably uncomfortable to rely on customer support to actually cancel a day prior to the next billing date. Once I cancelled my subscription, it *also* cancelled my service for the month that *I had already paid for*. This doesn’t make sense and is not customer-service friendly or mental-health friendly — it comes off as a money-hungry company. Why would you cancel the service for the month that you had already paid ahead of time for?  When it comes to any other service that you pay ahead of time for, once you cancel and get the confirmation of cancellation, it is applicable to the next billing cycle as you maintain the service for the remainder of which you had already paid for. After asking one last time for a refund and kindly requesting for said Employee to provide some Customer Support, I was responded with:

“Please be advised that we operate on a subscription model, the monthly fee is not based on services being rendered (i.e., receiving new medication, meeting with a therapist or prescriber). I do know that this is not the response that you would like to receive, and I sincerely apologize that we cannot be more flexible here. I completely understand your disappointment and do hope that you are able to find care that is a great fit for you.”

The Employee was kind and respectful, but as a Customer Support employee myself who also works in a Subscription field, I do not think much customer support was provided, especially when I kindly asked  for a refund a couple of times. It was rather a robotic response with a lack of empathy; you *can* be more flexible, but you choose not to; you can escalate it, give a customer a one-time courtesy refund so that they will come back. This may very well not be the employee’s fault, but rather, upper management. Given this experience, I will choose to not come back.",Cerebral tends to be money-hungry.

However, the service and response time has gotten awful. When they changed my dose my medication price doubled without warning. I have OptumRx prescription insurance and have requested that they transfer my prescription since my medication would cost a third of what i’m currently
paying. It’s been nearly a month since my request. They responded saying they would get back to me. Exactly 10 days later I still hadn’t heard from them so I gave them a nudge. Same response, they’ll get back to me. I told them i was nearly out of medication and asked that they refill my prescriptions once more while I wait for the transfer since I was almost out of pills. As of today I still have not gotten anywhere with this and I have less than two days of medication left. The refill hasn’t shipped nor has it even been processed. I am terrified of what will happen when I run out of medication. Withdrawals from a strong dose of antidepressants can be catastrophic. I rely heavily on the anxiety medication as well. At this point I don’t know what to do. Every time I ask for an update I get the same response: they’re looking into it and will get back to me.

The only reason I gave two stars is because they prescribed me medication that gave me my life back. Now i’m worried that i’ll be worse off than before I started the medication when I start to go through withdrawals.

I’m a very straightforward person. I told my backstory, how that effects me, and how I’d like to improve, and what type of things I expected from therapy/needed.

The first therapist was an okay person, but bad therapist.. He literally compared every “problem” of mine to a bigger problem he had once in his life. He provided no coping mechanisms. And talked like a fortune cookie. No help whatsoever. He made life sound like a sad existence that you just have to get used to... No Thanks!!

Second therapist was a young woman who just sounded really cocky after we actually talked. Like she knew everything and how to fix everything. But didn’t actually try to “fix” anything. And basically belittled me and told me what I thought was wrong and sent a passive aggressive message “proving” me wrong. 

Third one seemed like she would have been actually helpful. Helped me learn a breathing technique right away. But we didn’t really talk as much as I hoped we could. And by this point, I wasn’t really willing to waste more time and money on this app. 

As I was trying to cancel my subscription they kept offering me cheaper and cheaper deals and plans. Not sure if it was because they actually want to provide help to less fortunate people, or because they want any and all money they can get...

Either way, it would be nice if they could screen their employees before letting them actually see patients. People deserve great mental health care and I’ve seen a couple subpar therapists right off the bat. Real therapy can and should help you. And it shouldn’t be this hard to find a good therapist.

- Called that number and asked for a refund. She asked a bunch of questions like the last four of my cards and the expiration but said someone ELSE would be emailing me about canceling.

1. First question was how you doing? To which I replies: pretty bad.
2. I then proceeded to tell the therapist: i cry every other night over my break up only for her to ask me: and how does the breakup make you feel. Guess?
3. Every response from my therapist had a 2 minute lag, which I understand if I was typing my life story but she asked me if i had any support i felt comfortable with, my response was “ nope i dont” —2 minute wait — she then asked: any friends you feel supported by.

It took two weeks before they allowed me to make an appointment… for a week later.

The session was supposed to lead to more counseling, but the very first thing was “what meds are you on?” “Oh, we cannot give you anything…” “You don’t want a prescription? Really? Then what do you want?”

Never mind that I completed my profile in excruciating detail. The therapist never even read any of it.

Then she was supposed to schedule a followup, but disconnected from me before doing so.

I used the service because I move around a lot and was looking for more consistency with my medication routine. At first, I couldn’t be more pleased with my service. I had a prescriber who cared and a care counselor who was useful and helped me in relevant ways. For instance, my initial prescriber went out of her way to help me get my medication at an affordable price and went so far as to call me on my personal cell phone to ensure that I was taken care of. 

Everything went down hill when that prescriber left the service. 

I have been bounced around to a new prescriber each month. This means that each month I must go over my entire medication history, relay trauma to a new person, and wait to get an appointment. Appointments with prescribers must be made two months in advance and most have very limited availability (like 10 PM EST). To be quite honest, that wouldn’t bother me too much as I was getting consistent care. 

But I’m not. 

Every month since May 2021 I have had to go a week without medication because my prescriber does not renew my prescription. Every month we go through the same routine (regardless of who my current prescriber is): I notice I have 7 pills left and message my care coordinator for a refill, three days later my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber and let them know, after not hearing something for several days I contact again when I have one or two pills left, my care coordinator says they will contact my prescriber again and they will respond within 48 hours, I call customer service because I need medication, I go through sudden withdrawal for a day while I wait, I get my medication. 

If that wasn’t enough, I have been switched to a new medication regime with ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE from my prescriber. I was given no instructions or warning that I would be forced to go through withdrawal from my medications I had previously been on. As of right now, I have been trying to contact my “care team” for over 48 hours for hep with no response. 

The worse part of this experience is I truly, genuinely need help. I have been left in a state where I cannot stand for more than 20 minutes at a time (no shower, no driving, no cleaning, no cooking, no working). I have used every appropriate avenue available to me and have still be IGNORED by this service. 

If you’re in a situation where you are looking to use this service, please do not. I am begging you. My mental health is absolutely worse since using this service. The worst part is I am now dependent on this medication and cannot terminate usage of the service until I can get an appointment with a psychiatrist who gives a crap about me.","Please, for your sake, don’t.",cerebral-mental-health,1537193671,0,1,0

I’m in between in-person therapists. They had a person who responded through the app set me up despite it being late at night, which was cool, but I immediately spotted some pretty concerning things with their business model. I subscribed for a month, and they gave me four credits for tele-appointments. The catch is that they gave me a deadline to use those credits, which was a month from when I paid, which would be fine except that it would be almost a week in to that time before my therapist’s first available appointment time. On top of that my therapist in his first message to me said he is spending 10 days before Christmas on vacation, which leaves me wondering how I’m supposed to actual use all of these credits.

And this would all be fine, except when I tried to get a refund the automated program only offered me a partial refund (2/3 of the original fee), despite 1) only having paid a fews days prior, 2) not having any appointments scheduled and never having spoken to my therapist, and 3) not using the service in any tangible way. I contacted support, and despite being able to get a real person to help me immediately in the middle of the night to sign up, it’s been four days and I still haven’t heard back from anyone.
