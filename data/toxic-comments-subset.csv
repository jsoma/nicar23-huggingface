 Errata for the Batman page? 

Hi,

I think you were the last person to edit the Batman page.

I was just wondering, it states """"Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne"""" (2nd paragragph, 1st line)
Shouldn't it be Batman's True Identity is Bruce Wayne?

I might be wrong since it is supposed to be the original version, but it just sound funny to me.

following is a repaste of last complete version...

The guineafowl are a family of birds in the same order as the pheasants, turkeys and other game birds. They are also widely known as guineahens, (a term formerly applied to the turkey).

This is an African family of insect and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds resembling partridges, but with featherless heads and spangled grey plumage. The Helmeted Guineafowl has been domesticated and introduced outside its natural range, for example in southern France and the West Indies. 

Guineas are monogamous, spending their lives with the same mate. They lay 25-30 eggs in a deep, tapering nest. Their eggs are small, and dark. The hens have a habit of hiding their nests, and sharing it with others until large numbers of eggs have accumulated. The incubation period is 26-28 days, and the babies are called """"keets."""" They are highly susceptible to dampness (after all, they come from drier areas of Africa) and can die from following the mother through dewy grass. Though, after their first two weeks, they can be some of the hardiest domestic land fowl. 

Sexing the birds is not as simple as telling a rooster from a hen chicken. When they are adults, the helmet and wattles of the male are larger then the female, and the female is the only one to make the two-note cry """"Buck-wheat!"""" Aside from that, however, the two sexes are mostly identical in appearance. 

As domestics, guineas are valuable pest controllers, delighting in ridding your yard and garden of insects. They are especially beneficial in controlling the lyme disease carrying deer tick, as well as annoying wasp nests. While they are rarely kept in large numbers, a few are sometimes kept with other fowl to be used as a security system against hawks. No intruder or stranger will get past the eye of a guinea, and they will call, loudly, with their high shrieking voices. They are highly social birds, and hate to be alone. 

Within the domesticated species, many color variations have been created aside from the """"pearl"""" or natural color of the helmeted guinea. These include White, purple, slate, chocolate, lavander, and coral blue.

 Definition for the list

The current list includes a lot of cases that can be (sub)categorized in other ways, such as """"international terrorism"""" (including state-sponsored international terrorism), War Crimes, and Human Rights Violations. Perhaps there could be one list that uses a narrow definition of state terrorism, followed by the more general list.

 Misleading reference to study? 

In the section on lead paint in art (which I largely wrote), someone added the following:

""""Lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.""""

As I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of """"Chinese White"""" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally """"flake white"""" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above. If someone has more information on this, please mention it here; otherwise when I come back I'm going to delete that paragraph or water it down (no pun intended).""",0,0,0,0,0,0

He is also  blocking outside the scope of the arbcom decision, even if one incorrectly asserts that I am party to it, including blocking (17 February 2007)  for contributing to (not voting!) a  deletion discussion; this was not an article, and participation is not disallowed.  FM then removed evidence that showed he was acting inappropriately.  He also made a previous block on 20 July 2006, incorrectly citing the arbcom decision of 'associated articles', while first providing no evidence, then false evidence (diff he provided was not to Ken Ham), to justify his accusation and inappropriate block.  (Note that KillerChihuahua removed evidence from that page, claiming that it was posted by a banned user, while no one in that decision was banned from Wikipedia; therefore, the removal was inappropriate.)  

 The reason and contest of the block is obviously that the blocking admin acted inappropriately by placing a block against someone on the 'other side' of a content dispute (and removing evidence by deleting a post that was not his own) in the first place. 

You don't ask a homeowner whose television has been stolen to justify why his house has so many windows.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The wording of the most recent edit is needs tweaking. Reading the source provided, Hunter wrote in opposition of a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces, an unreliable Afghan Leadership, concerns regarding roadside bombs, and what he saw as """"Obama administration's other shortcomings"""" which he termed """"mixed messages"""" to American service members and the world. And as stated by the Administration in 2012, there are were no plans for a complete withdraw; which had changed as recently as recently as this month to possible withdrawal after 2014. Therefore, upon closer review the summarization of the source is wrong.
As for the second part, I would say the best way to word it would be something like:

So in the end I am proposing the following wording:

 Central Americans are not North Americans! 

We are own people and we are not Northerners.  We are seperate from them and are nothing like them! You can try to correct me, but the people who say that we are North Americans are White folk who try to keep us down (and sometimes other ignorant groups of people).  I will never surrender to being North American and nor should any other Central American should ever buy into this.  I don't care what the White man tells us.  They're not us.  We should be able to decide for ourselves who we are and no else should tell us who to be.  This is just another way of bringing us down.  I am proud of being Central American and being someone who inhabited this land long before the White people made contact with us.  If we have been living here for the longest time, should it not be us who decides who we want to be? 

-Tito A. Martĩnez
This is a lovely essay, but unfortunately you cannot undeclare yourself a north american any more easily than you can underclare yourself an earthling.  Central America happens to be located in North America, so Central Americans are North Americans - it's a geographical thing, not a cultural thing. Perhaps you're thinking of Latin America and Anglo America?  

Actually, Tito can """"undeclare himself"""". If you'll check the Spanish Wikipedia articles on Central America and North America, you will see that Spanish language defines North America's southern-most country as Mexico. 
:es:Norteamérica redirects to es:América del Norte, which lists the lists the following political units in north to south order:
Greenland
Canada
United States
Mexico
Note that Central America is not on this list!

WilyD is also right, as far as English language goes. """"North America"""" includes Mexico and Central America. 

I think America (terminology) should provide a better explanation than it currently does. A section on English vs. Spanish terminology would help. (I don't speak Spanish, but I studied French in high school and can sometimes puzzle out the meaning. Maybe I'll recruit some bilingual Wikipedians to help me write this. -)  

Okay, but I'll claim the fatal flaw here is this:  América del Norte is a spanish term that is different from the english term North America.  Tito may not be a norteamericano - (although I don't think he declares himself here either - doesn't spanish have an equivilent to L'academie?) - but he's still north american.  

Actually, I don't think """"North American"""" is an identity that applies to Latin Americans. His country (if it's in Central America) is a part of the North American continent, but the cultural division is what he's concerned about. Want to help me update America (terminology)?  

I think America (terminology) reflects correct english usage.  Maybe Use of the word American is a better place to move these kind of complaints (although I'm actively involved in that article, and know it'll get shot down as original research).  Roughly speaking, there aren't political continents - Wikipedia has articles on Anglo America (not that I'm convinced the term exists) in contrast",0,0,0,0,0,0

Happy belated: birthday, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and Groundhog Day.

Take a break from all the WP nannying. Hope you're doing great @ MIT.

Take another look at December 2008’s and last month’s archived portal pages and see if they work correctly on your end. Shades of Extreme Home Makeover - etc.

This may be the closest I get to re-mastering old films, like they now have to do for Blu-Ray. Feels like it, fun but tedious.

Some of these archived portal pages I've trundled through going back to Jan of '08 (so far) succumb to table-formatting bugs (on my platform [Tiger/Safari (+FF3)]). So I kludged the position of the calendars. But these two months work fine. No clue as to why they break. Is there a documented bug? This seems to be some kind of CSS error.

The Portal:Current events/How to archive the portal page must not be visited very often of late, so I'm attempting to make its link more prominent by adding a comment above the """"fold"""". Don't have a clue how many editors might contribute to the upkeep of this, though.

Here are handy linx for you to peruse these pages, only the last 2 have reconstructed sidebars As Of This Writing (hereinafter """"AOTW""""):

January 2008 (works okay on my plat)

February 2008 (broken, so it's kludged)

March 2008 (okay)

April 2008 (okay)

May 2008 (works okay, International hols are an embarrassment [why just May?])

June 2008 (works OK)

July 2008 (breaks with prescribed table formatting, so it's kludged)

August 2008 (OK)

September 2008 (OK)

October 2008 (OK)

November 2008 (also breaks so it's kludged. Don't know what'll happen if we attempt to reconstruct & restore a local [temporally speaking ;)] sidebar)

December 2008 (Okay and complete, with the important comment that it's an archived section)

January 2009 (Also OK, as above)

So pass the word along that some spadework has been done, and it's as self-explanatory as I can manage to make it. Thanx again for all the great work on this design, unjustly neglected.

From Fraser:

This article possesses a number of quite significant errors:

First, concerning the so-called characteristics of the deep house sound, many deep house tracks have a 'thumpy' bass drum sound, thus making them practicable for a dancefloor; although there is a wide use of effects employed in the production of deep house music, the use of filters etc., is no more prevalent than in other sub-genres of house, for instance disco house (where filters are used ad nauseum) and dub house (where reverb and echo are pronounced). 

In contrast to the traits mentioned in the article that characterise the deep house sound, I would argue that the most defining characteristic of the music is its mood, being typically abstract and atmospheric, more concerned with taking the listener on a mental expedition that making a dancefloor move.

 A brief biography of fourth Chokhor Tenzin Chogyal 

Chokhor Rinpoche was born to father Kalsang Dorjee and mother Kalsang Chokey on 20th Oct, 1979 (the day was on auspicious day of Dipawali) in Kalimpong, the hill station of West Bengal, North East state of India. 

While Ripoche’s mother was pregnant, there were so many auspicious signs showed to her. She often dreamt of a white rabbit sleeping on her lap; thousand of twinkling stars entering to her womb and became different jewels. She also often dreamt a huge and well built guy with fire on his body almost look like Vajrapani was appeared and talked to her without any frightening. She also dreamt a white clothed young guy came and told her to go with him on riding dragon and hovered in the sky several times. And often that guy comes in her dream and told to keep that white rabbit and feed well. On the forth night of Rinpoche’s birthday, she dreamt same. After gave birth of of Rinpoche, Dhardo Rinpoche named him “Lhundub”.

After a year, the little Lhundub used to do pray in front of the photo of His Holiness with the decoration different fruits as offering. He also used to sit on piled pillows and saying he is Lama and take his blessing, to his relative children. Moreover, the little boy was happy to visit monastery and meet monks.

When the little boy was on four years old, he often told his dream to his parent that he dreamt of a lord of charnel grounds [having the form of a skeleton] telling him that your home is not a place of long term living, you need to go far distance where there is huge temple, and you should go with two person who would come to invite you. Rinpoche still remember that dream he told to his mother several times.

In the beginning of year 1983, the little boy started to go English School in Kalimpong. In the winter of that year, the boy Rinpoche and his parents and grandparents visited to Bodhagaya, where he got the full discourse of Shantideva’s Bodhisatvacharyavatara from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. While in Bodhgaya, Rinpoche’s parents were visited Pangnang Rinpoche whom they asked soothing of little boy’s well beings. Pangnang Rinpoche, after drawing of dice for soothing told that nothing to worry and added name “Tsondue” after his name “Lhundup”. There after the little boy was called “Lhundub Tsondue”.

While little boy, Lhundub Tsondue was on his routine to Nursery school, on 21st March, 1985, he was recognized as the unmistaken reincarnation of 3rd Chokhor Rinpoche by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. After two years later his admittance to Lhopa Khangtsen in Sera Jey Monastic University in south India, the eight-year-old Lhundub Tsondue was invited by Geshe Jampa Topgyal and Geshe Gyaltsen of Lhopa Khangtsen in 1986. The first hair cutting ceremony was taken by Sera Jey Khensur Ngawang Legden and given name as “Ngawang Choekyi Gyaltsen” and admitted to the monastery.

Few days after his admission to the monastery, Geshe Jampa Topgyal taught few alphabets to read as dependent-arising. Then Geshe Gyaltsen took Rinpoche to consult Geshe Ngawang Choesang of Tsangpa Khangtsen as a teacher. On Geshe Ngawang la’s guidance of long fifteen years, Rinpoche learned from the beginning of reading and writing, Tibetan Calligraphy, Sumchupa and Tagjug, Tibetan literature. During the consultation of Geshe Ngawang la, Rinpoche memorized all daily prayers and the root text of (Abhisamaya Alamkara, Madhyamikavatara, Abhi Dharma Khosh).Recited hundred thousand of “Tendrel Toepa”,(Praise of Dependent Arising, by Tsongkhapa). While consulting Geshe Ngawang Choesang, Rinpoche also went to Sera Je Secondary School for five years. 

In 1988, during the Lamrim teaching by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Chokhor Rinpoche got the first privately audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Drepung monastery. His Holiness gave him name “Tenzin Chogyal“.

In 1992, Chokhor Rinpoche left the academic studies and joined the monastic education with consultation of Gyume Khensur Lobsang Delek as teacher. In 1994, Rinpoche took novice vow from His Eminence Choden Rinpoche and added name “Palsangpo” after “Tenzin Chogyal” as novice name.

As the rule and regulation of the monastery, in 1996, 25th day of 6th month Rinpoche was stood on the Rigchung ceremony in the congregation of Sera Jey monks, everyone was surprised with his under/over tone of explanation with melancholic tune and answering of debate opponent.

While studying the fundamental philosophy in the monastery, on the two month vacation, Chokhor Rinpoche used to accomplish the recitation of Mig-tsema and some vocation took complete retreat on Yamantaka and had its burnt sacrifices. In 1999 Rinpoche was invited to Italy by his sponsor during the vacation, Rinpoche taught and gave lecture on Tibetan issue to Italian",0,0,0,0,0,0

809b920c34be014a,"""Hi. You should be aware of the following official Wikipedia policies - this is an excerpt from WP:EL:

 Links normally to be avoided 
 
Except for a link to a page that is the subject of the article or an official page of the article subject—and not prohibited by restrictions on linking—one should avoid:
 Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article.
 Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research. See Reliable sources for explanations of the terms """"factually inaccurate material"""" or """"unverifiable research"""".
 Any site that attempts to surreptitiously install malware on a visitor's computer.
 Links mainly intended to promote a website.
 Links to sites that primarily exist to sell products or services. For example, instead of linking to a commercial bookstore site, use the """"ISBN"""" linking format, giving readers an opportunity to search a wide variety of free and non-free book sources.

You recently added a link to Western honey bee that violated the last two of these restrictions; I know the temptation to use WP to promote your site is strong, and you can claim that your site includes useful information, but it STILL self-promotion, and you SELL things on that website. You can't link that on Wikipedia. Note the following additional excerpt from the same policy page:

 Advertising and conflicts of interest 

Due to the rising profile of Wikipedia and the amount of extra traffic it can bring a site, there is a great temptation to use Wikipedia to advertise or promote sites. This includes both commercial and non-commercial sites. You should avoid linking to a website that you own, maintain or represent, even if the guidelines otherwise imply that it should be linked. If the link is to a relevant and informative site that should otherwise be included, please consider mentioning it on the talk page and let neutral and independent Wikipedia editors decide whether to add it. This is in line with the conflict of interest guidelines. Note that since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links may not alter search engine rankings.

This is not personal, it's simply a matter of an official WP policy, and everyone has to play by the same rules.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Any line segment can be divided continuously ad infinitum.
At all times, with each division, the length of each part shortens by a half,
while at the same time, the number of parts multiplies by two.
So, how can an infinite number of parts
make up a finite whole? Because for every division, the lengths
of the parts are reducing as fast as the number of parts are increasing.   

There is not enough in sources for Zeno's writings to fully justify saying that Zeno ever actually claimed that the sum of an infinite number of numbers is infinite - though he has been interpreted that way by some. What is clear is that he thinks a task with an infinite number of steps cannot be completed.   01:03, 10 August 2012",0,0,0,0,0,0

If  thinks that two wrongs always must make a right, he has the right to do so. But it takes all credibility out of Wikipedia to keep use incorrect sources only because they in turn copy the same mistake over and over and over and over.

This goes back to at least the 19th century, probably more. This is something I became aware of long time ago after spending hours digging in archives doing researches for numerous books and magazine articles about Swedish aviation history over the years. Why do you think it's SK 60 and not SK60 in the aricle(or even worse the Americanized SK-60)? The designation system is the same for Army bases, Air Force bases, Navy bases, radar, cameras, robots, airplanes, vehicles, guns, actually anything that goes into an inventory list including engines both piston and jets! Military systems anywhere are not exactly known for being flexible. Everything should be conformed the same. It should be the same with Wikipedia. If we want to spell the engine designation incorrect, then the airplane designation has to be changed to the incorrect """"SK60"""" as well! This goes for all other SAAB aircraft articles in all languages on Wikipedia! It has to be either, we can't have both! Personally I think it's easier to change a few incorrect spellings than hundreds that are already correct! After all, this is about common sense!! 

Also remember that a commercial website is often made by a webmaster who doesn't really know anything about the subject. This is not only true about Volvo Aero's web, but also the Swedish Armed Forces website who also have some similar misspellings. Sometimes they get it right though! (i.e. misspellings are not consistent on their web!) And yeah, even sorces like Jane's sometimes get it wrong!

Yes, it is the vertical component of momentum of this """"body of air"""", moving with the flow, that is increasing. And then it does not matter whether you talk about and Eulerian or Lagrangian frame of reference. Or whether the air is flowing around the airfoil, or the airfoil flying through air at rest (far from the airplane). This body of air has to be large (many chord lengths in diameter, say five or more), for the effects of the airfoil on the boundary to be small enough to be negligible (from a practical point of view; a case which not satisfies this is the ground effect where the boundary influences the kinematics and forces).    11:21, 28""",0,0,0,0,0,0
91ee7795751d1c59,""":::::::Dictatorship of the status quo?!

Looking through the archives here, it seems that discussion of the article's name has almost entirely revolved around a suggested move to """"British India"""".  Clearly such a move would be outright wrong.  But that still leaves us with the problem that while """"British Raj"""" does seem to get usage as a name for the territories under the authority of the Governor-General in Council, it's also used as the name for a period (see the article lede at """"History of the British Raj"""" by way of example).  In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.  That's why I think """"Indian Empire"""" is better; it's clearly about a country.  Alternatively, and I say this through slightly gritted teeth, we could have it at """"British Indian Empire"""".

As for usage by historians, surely they most commonly use the simple term """"India""""?  Which is not of course to say that other terms don't get used (especially in book titles).

I still believe that Raven's fate is resting on Disney. Disney made her a star again adn now she is leaving them, which makes me think that after That's So Raven has aired the finale and died down a little, Raven won't get any work again. She'll be right where she started before she won the lead on TSR.

Also, so you also believe that 3LW is coming to an end? Because I personally do. And I think that you implied that.

Finally, I think that the group did all depend on each other but personally I am hoping that Hollywood Records will let the Cheetahs become mainstream and not keep them in Disney forever like Raven. I also think that the group can be mainstream successful without Raven, but they will have to work hard to do that. Hopefully their new single will do good and sell albums for the girls.  21:15",0,0,0,0,0,0

71634950b1e81ccb,"That’s not really long and irrelevant. I mean, I told you above about General McCully who was always talking about really irrelevant things. Once he told me a story about myself (I’m not sure why I’d never been told it before by my family, but there you go, that’s families for you – not that I wish to make disparaging remarks about my family, they were quite nice, only you’d think that they’d tell me important things like this thing that General McCully told me).

Anyway, this story went as follows (of course, it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead, I won’t get it absolutely 100% word perfect, but I’ll get the plot details correct, which is all that matters in the long run, and in the short run too, probably):

Once, I went to tea with a girl called Sophie (to fully appreciate this amusing, and I may add, most relevant anecdote, you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie: in fact, we were both only four or five at the time; these ages are, you will no doubt agree, far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place). Anyway, for reasons General McCully couldn’t quite remember (I was at least ten at the time, and being a fairly old man, General McCully didn’t have a fantastic memory), this girl Sophie (you may remember – she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions) put her spoon in my hair. Now, at this point in the story, you may well be saying to yourself, “So what?” But, the problem was, the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it.

So this was, as you’ll no doubt appreciate, quite a difficult situation, and in the confusion I couldn’t help noticing the slightly random (and, I’ll have to admit, irrelevant) fact that the screws on which Sophie’s mother’s pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead, rather than a Phillips, screwdriver (when I say flathead, do not use this term in its most obvious, literal definition, but as the DIY term in fairly common use).

Anyway, there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face, examining the screws on my hostess’ mother’s pictures, and casting dark aspersions, and eventually I just walked out and went home, all on my own.

Now, when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General, he may not actually be a General: the British Army (the army in which he had served) had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre, random and irrelevant term “General”, including Major-General, and I don’t know if he was simply one of these, since they’re usually addressed simply as “General”, as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully.

Come to think of it, there even used to be a Brigadier-General rank and even a weird-sounding Captain-General rank in the British army, though I believe the rank of Brigadier-General still lives on in the United States Army, existing under some obscure, weird, bizarre, random and irrelevant star rating too, such as “three-star general”, though this almost certainly (speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability) isn’t the right term for the rank of Brigadier-General.

Anyway, being a busy person, I can’t waste any more of my valuble time on this, unfortunately.",0,0,0,0,0,0

b169389106b471ea,"""I responded thusly, in a new ANI thread (the old one was long gone by the time my block ended):
A while ago, I made some edits that Johntex didn't like, and so instead of trying to resolve it on the article discussion page, he posted a wildly dishonest complaint in which he resorted to outright lying about me to get me blocked from editing the page for a month (his initial goal being to get me completely banned). I continued to be outraged at his behavior and the fact that he remains completely unpunished for his behavior, and posted complaints on his talk page. Once again, rather than trying to resolve it, he went here to lie about me in his continued belief that anyone who annoys him should be banned. And yet again, he posted numerous lies:

5 days ago, with no provocation whatsoever, Heqwm made a personal attack against me on my talk page. As explained above, the claim that there was no provocation whatsoever is an outright lie.

I have never posted lies about him. Another lie.

I left him a message on his talk page asking him to provide diffs to back up his allegations. He declined to do so. Another lie. I pointed out that I had provided him with the diffs over and OVER again, and each time he simply lied and said that they don't say what he said they clearly said.

Wizardman warned Heqwm that this was a personal attack. Heqwm repeated his personal attack on his own talk page. I removed the """"anti-barnstar"""" and personal attack from my talk page, but Heqwm re-added it. I discussed the charge on my talk page. And Johntes's recounting is dishonest, as it implies that my reposting the attack happened after Wizardman's warning, when in fact it happened before.

Heqwm has been at this mischief for a long time. Mischief? Insisting that liars be punished is """"miscief""""? What kind of world do we live in?

He has been warned by other users as well, and has been placed on a form of community probation. Yes, on the basis of the very lies that are the issue here.

I don't think I have any any interaction with him since then, so I can only assume he is still upset about being put on probation, or about the related mediation case which he filed and then abandoned. Abandoned after several weeks went by without any mediator stepping forward (and after Johntex engaged in behavior in blatant violation of WP:CIVIL and WP:AGF).

His talk page history is littered with controversy and conflict with many other editors on many topics. After several years, with me not deleting anything, there are now several instances of people disagreeing with me. And...?

I ask whether Heqwm has exhausted the community's patience? I ask whether this is not a clear threat and an instance of Johntex's bullying.

To top it off, another admin came along and blocked me only a few hours after Johtex's request, meaning that I had no opportunity to address the charges.

-

Jonhtex responded """"I request that Heqwm again be blocked for posting unsubstantiated personal attacks where he accuses me of lying.""""  So... Johntex is allowed to attack me on ANI, but if I respond to his charges, I should be blocked?  Yet another example of his bullying.

Hi Darius, a part of the reason I think the genocide looms so large, and deserves space in a 3 paragraph summary is because it is still a """"big deal"""" and current event topic.  There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.

Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The """"neutrality"""" of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

Hi. Could you please stop enforcing the category """"Christian arabs"""" on non arabic Christians living in the middle east? This is wrong.

I looked at what you did there, and unsuprisingly I saw this edit of yours:

According to orthodox Jewish and Christian eschatological beliefs, and secular historians and scholars, the concept of the Son of Perdition (also called """"the beast that goes into perdition"""" in Revelation  and ) is used in the Bible in one or more of three contexts, forming a triunism (or trinity,http://www.nathan.co.za/message.asp?sermonum=10 see paragraph 40 or typology)Kinship of God and man: An attempt to formulate a thorough-going Trinitarian theology, by J.J. Lanier, see """"Trinitarian Idealism,"""" pp 135-147, esp. Syllabus II, p 136 of three potential interpretive references.Kinship of God and man: An attempt to formulate a thorough-going Trinitarian theology, by J.J. Lanier see """"Trinitarian Idealism,"""" pp 135-147, esp. Syllabus II, p 136

1) First of all, none of the sources cited say anything about the three context """"forming a triunism or trinity"""". None of them. Your claim that this is """"According to orthodox Jewish eschatology and Christian eschatology, and secular historians and scholars"""" is completely unsubstantiated by the citations given.
2) Secondly, all three of the sources you cite are sources which you have been told repeatedly not to use because they are not WP:RS. One of them is predictably yet another link to the website on which your own work is advertised, with your idiosyncratic view. So you're not adhering to Wiki policy, and you're deliberately disobeying what you've been asked to do on many previous occasions. Your edit here is a typical example of your WP:SYNTH and WP:OR.
3) Thirdly, you haven't ever provided a single quotation from Bruce or Reed which shows they support your idiosyncratic """"triunisms"""" idea. Your claim that they do is completely unsupported by the works of theirs which you cite, and is another example of your WP:SYNTH and WP:OR. You can't point to something they've written and claim that because you interpret it as supporting your view, that it supports your view. That's not how Wikipedia works. You need a third party citation from a WP:RS which interprets them as supporting your view.You have been told this repeatedly.~~~~

Rao doesn't need to reject Talbot's revisionism, because he merely states the existing narrative that Nayaks fought to liberate their own country from Turk muslims. It is Talbot & Eaton who come up with the """"theory"""" that the Nayaks had revised their own history as if they needed to in order to liberate their own country from foreigners. Had you read carefully, you would have seen above where I say that Rao himself pre-dates Talbot. If you wanted page numbers for anything (let alone that odd request of an older source needing to explicitly reject a new theory), then you and your friend should have simply asked like adults, with civility. 
 When I have received even an opinion on the merits to my proposal above, then we can continue this interaction, since you both have been making bad faith edits without consensus and have now reverted my own edit. I didn't even ask for much just """"According to Talbot and Eaton"""", and even that was reverted. Why such stubbornness? You don't own these pages nor are you the review panel.I sense another reason for such behavior given our previous interaction, yet another reason for your appearance here. Be advised that Wikipedia is for good faith editors who want to improve the content, not for bad faith editors who have a vendetta against someone for a sockpuppet investigation. And tell your friends to stop issuing threats on my talk page. 

Either way, I responded now to make myself clear. But since you clearly don't have the understanding of the subject matter, rather than waste everyone's time, you should just let your friend do the edits and lead the discussion (assuming even he is interested in that), and you can just go back to helping him circumvent 3RR when he needs you to.

Roc Nation Template
Hi there ,

I'm sure you a nice person, but I would like to know the reason of why you have removed just the name of Tinchy Stryder and no other names on the Template:Roc Nation just under reason of """"Reverting edits by block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" when In fact I have been unblocked since 16 September 2011, and all the edits I have made to the Template:Roc Nation since the end of my ban have all been in good faith and correction of information and also of other WPA edits I have made from the knowledge I have on a specific WPA, have been made after my 1 month ban from the 16 August 2011 to 16 Sep 2011. So I just don't understand what you mean by """"block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" and when Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template way before I had made any edits to the template, and all I persume is that the reason why Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template in the first place was that he is a key member of Roc Nation due to him being co-owner of Roc Nation UK-based subsidiary Takeover Roc Nation record label and entertainment company, the same goes to Stargate (production team) who are the co-owners of the Roc Nation US-based StarRoc record label and publishing company. I would be grateful if you can give an explanation and if bias reverting of WPA edits, which is what this looks like in my oppinion is allowed by Wikipedia as I'm pretty sure it is not. I would like to think this is not a biased issue as I'm sure your a nice person . Thank you.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I contend that in the first section, yes Legalese makes a valid point that he does majorly include points to support his edits also, but my assertion that the second section (""""Be civil IAF"""") is meant solely for a personal attack. It merely has the cloak of redundant information i.e. which was already posted earlier by Legalese in another section, and its main aim (as the title itself suggests) is to lecture me about what he percieves is """"civility"""". On this, Legalese definitely deserves a warning .

Again, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.

The charge that I am not being a """"good"""" editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as """"good editing"""" or """"Objectionable behaviour"""".

His lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of """"civility"""" and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.

Besides, I never said that I find the """"word-war"""" offending to me on part of Legalese. So an Unconditional Apology on my part does not arise at all. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you are going to put in Iranians in your List of Azerbaijani's, then it will say Iranians next to their names. You dont go to List of Israeli's to find the names of all the famous Jews in the world do you? Iranians belong in the list of Iranians, simple as that, that is why the list of Iranians is in there. The list of Azerbaijani's should only include those from the R. of Azerbaijan. I see no more point in discussing this issue any further either, those three figures should be removed, as well as the Iranians. 02:05, 9",0,0,0,0,0,0

Observe:

A=B.

Multiply both sides by A and you get:

A2=AB.

Add A2 to both sides to get:

A2+A2=A2+AB.

Using addition we get:

2A2=A2+AB.

Subtract 2AB from both sides:

2A2-2AB=A2+AB-2AB.

Thus:

2A2-2AB=A2-AB.

Combining terms on the LHS:

2(A2-AB)= A2-AB.

Divide both sides by  (A2-AB):

2(A2-AB)/(A2-AB)= (A2-AB)/(A2-AB).

Cancel out like terms and Viola!  We now see:

2 = 1.

So nothing is gained from addition by subtraction.

Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland‎' bias accusation
It's one thing to disagree on content, another entirely for you to make an accusation of bias. If you have any moral compass whatsoever, you will now either substantiate your accusation or withdraw it and apologise. Ad hominem attacks are not acceptable.  (talk) 
It was not an attack. It was an observation. You've already distorted her words. For example, you inserted a claim that """"she dismisses criticism as uninformed and bitchy"""", which is not what the source said. If my observation was wrong, I am sorry, but I'm not convinced that it was. I hope that you will prove otherwise.   
The leap you need to explain is how you get from your assertion of """"not what the source said"""" to bias. The source said of one set of critics """"Gardeners are quite bitchy, aren't they"""". Of another, """"There was only a handful of grand English lady designers, and the bitchiness I encountered was unbelievable"""". These would seem to support an assertion that she dismissed critics as bitchy. How many times in one piece must we read such dismissals before we conclude that she dismisses critics as bitchy? And how, however you view my sentence construction, does it amount to bias? You have made the assertion. It is now down to you to explain yourself.  (talk) 

This isn't going away, Surtsicna. You no more get to walk away from this than you would if you'd accused a banker of fraud or a teacher of child abuse.

Sounds like a plan! As for the extant descriptions of individual pieces, I've just been editing the article on his very best-known compositions, the two Romanian Rhapsodies and, if the state in which I found it is anything to go by, sources in English aren't worth much. (You might like to take a look at the edit history there.) For the rest, Enescu was not an ethnomusicologist (as Bartók and Kodlály were), and so it would be unreasonable to expect from him a deep knowledge of the rural folk music music of his country. It is also frequently observed that he """"absorbed"""" folk elements into his compositional style, rather than actually quoting folksongs—with a few exceptions, mainly the two Romanian Rhapsodies. Consequently, I wouldn't get my hopes up about any great revelations about the presence of actual non-gypsy Romanian folk music in Enescu's compositions.—  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

1e628cf121b5f5ba,"Avoiding Edit Wars 

Acroterion, I have been trying to avoid edit wars since I was unblocked last October 2008. I try to make articles more accurate, but sometimes it results in stepping on the toes of persons who have a particular point of view. I have learned the lesson from the past, not to push an issue. I have had a few prolonged discussions, but I have avoided edit wars on the main articles.

However, I would like to have your advice on a particular issue. It relates to a comment which I have just left on the talk page of 'Kepler's laws of planetary motion'. I do not intend to press the issue and I do not intend to make any more reverts. But I do feel that there is a matter here which needs to be observed.

I appreciate that phyics is not your topic, although I do know that you are scientific enough to grasp the concepts involved. I'll give you a quick summary. There are two equations involved in the Kepler problem, each with two terms on the active side. A couple of months ago, I was going to try and make major edits to this page, but I got stuck on the issue of agreeing names for the terms in the equations. You can see that discussion further up. There was general agreement about the actual equations, but no agreement on the names of the terms. So I lost interest and went elsewhere.

A few days ago, I returned to add what I considered to be very helpful information on elliptical orbits in relation to Kepler's second law. It was reverted. But it was reverted by a user who has only ever come to physics pages in my time, to revert my edits.

I will now walk away from that page because I don't want a repeat of what happened last July. Interestingly it was during an argument with this same user last July that indirectly led tome getting blocked, albeit that the final straw actually came on the Mozart page.

I intend to tidy up some more of the physics pages over the coming months. I am not asking you to do anything right now. But I would be grateful if you could monitor the situation and provide any advice because I do not believe that this guy is doing these reverts in the genuine spirit of promoting knowledge in physics.

your other advice would be useful if this was an ordinary dispute with well meaning people who disagree.  or if the topic was indeed trivial.  it is not appropriate to walk away from an article on the Holocaust because there are malicious and hostile editors who want to falsify the record or, what is happening here, ban basic facts on the Holocaust.  this is not a topic where it is acceptable to let the bad guys win - for me. is it okay with wiki administrators?  

i don't think it is appropriate to use mediation with what are functionally Holocaust deniers. this has been going on for six months. posts asking for consensus are ignored. any post they see as a challenge is answered within minutes.  i did walk away for several months, and more recently for days at a time and there is no relief. there has to be another level of getting help at wiki for truly intractable problems like unreasonable, malicious attacks on Holocaust information.

not taking sides or even knowing the topic of the dispute is fine when the dispute is between two sincere editors. but what if the dispute is about incontrovertible, non-controversial Holocaust history and editors who have dedicated themselves to keep it out of wiki and also to drive sincere editors off the page, if not to discourage them from ever participating in wiki again?  this is much bigger than my individual problem or this one article.  this is a wiki problem of how to deal with malicious spoilers.  cimicifugia",0,0,0,0,0,0

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

d6b5aa13e0c77fca,"Hmm... Not really sure what all you are asking. Geomorphology is the study of landforms. Structural geology is the study of structures (folds, faults, etc) within the rocks at scales varying from microscopic to continental. Now of course they are interrelated. Essentially, landforms are the product of erosive processes on the existing structure of the rocks involved and cannot be understood or explained without a good understanding of the geologic structure of the rocks. A geologist trying to decipher the structural geology of a region begins by studying the clues in the landforms. All is related. Now, there is a tendency of some geographers to think that geomorphology is a subdivision of geography and try to explain landforms without a thorough understanding of the structure, petrology, and stratigraphy on which the surface landforms develop. Landforms cannot be understood without knowledge of the geology on which they are formed.

 This article sounds like it was written by the UMWA 

It begins with adjectives like """"low"""" wages and """"poor"""" working conditions (against what standard?), and goes on from there.  I'm not saying that such those adjectives are wrong, simply that they are debatable (and have been debated for nearly a century).  It would be NPOV to say that the stikers were protesting their wages and working conditions, without the adjectives.  NPOV also requires a decent respect for the opinions of the owners who sincerely believed that unions were instigators of violence.

Also, unlike the prior comments in this discussion pertaining to certain unfortunate edits, I'm not saying that there weren't innocent and ill-willed parties in this event.  I'm simply suggesting that the history clearly coughs up both types of people on both sides of this conflict.

 Purpose of the usage section 

I've reverted edits that came with the explanation """"The purpose of this section is not to provide usage advice or to use intuitive but inaccurate descriptions like '""""doer of the action.'""""  Actually, the original text was well-supported by citations to usage manuals, and the particular words """"doer of the action"""" are directly from The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of English Usage, which linguists consider the best usage guide.  The edited language did not cite any support for its assertions.

More broadly, even if the replacement language did have good support, I don't think it would be as good for this section.  I recognize that Wikipedia is not a how-to guide, but in a section on English usage, I think the text should explain its meaning in a way that will be understood by someone to whom it is a new subject.

688da8c499296bfa,"I agree with Travellingcari. The tags serve a useful purpose, even after the article is brought to AfD, and especially so when they have been on the article for a significant length of time. They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The other uses, including the radio voice procedure, are handled on the disambiguation page because they are sought for by relatively few. Your arrangement—sending every searcher to the dab page—is a good solution when there is no clear primary topic. But in this case, it is an arrangement that unnecessarily inconveniences the 97 for the marginal benefit of the 3.

Words of Encouragement to user """"Damemk"""" in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.

I am expecting that this user """"Laveol"""" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.
Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.

Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    

Some insight into my user name Ejanev
The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is """"Ejanev"""". It is composed of the first letter of my name """"Emil"""" and my last name """"Janev"""".
User """"Damemk"""" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from """"Dame"""" - a Macedonian First name, and """"mk"""" or the code of """"Republic of Macedonia"""".
It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.

And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as """"Laveol"""", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.
I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.
You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.

 Our ancestors 

Most of us trace our musical origins to the B's, but, past the B's, everything, and I mean everything is due to The Fans, Pylon, and Vietnam.  The Fans had records on db (Danny Beard = db records).  Their single """"True,"""" in particular, is a fantastic distillation of half of what Athens would be (avail. on """"Squares Blot Out the Sun,"""" a db sampler).  Vietnam was never recorded.  The Fans split up, with Kevin Dunn remaining about the scene as a solo act (Kevin Dunn and the Tribe of Women were on db).  Alfredo Villar, the singer of The Fans, went back to his day job.  

The other thing is Pylon.  There just are    not     words for how important they were/are.  REM's favorite band is Pylon.  The B-52's favorite band is Pylon.  Everyone's favorite band was/is Pylon.

The other huge starting point is in Atlanta.  The Hampton Grease Band, despite being Atlantans, was a kick off to the whole idea that we could be weird and successful.  Although they claim that """"Music to Eat"""" sold fewer albums than any in Columbia history (not true, as a Yoga instructional record undersold them), they looked successful to us because they had integrity and played and got to pay their bills that way.  In particular, although that band's career was very brief, Bruce Hampton never went away.  Both in The Late Bronze Age and Aquarium Rescue Unit later, as well as the various incarnations as Hampton B. Coles and Colonel Bruce Hampton, he was a magnet for musicians.  Furthermore, Glenn Philips, who played guitar with the Grease Band when he was 15 years old, stuck around and continued to gig.

I'm a stinkin' expert on Athens 1980 - 1986.  After that, I quit my band and wandered away to academia, but I was one of Them back then.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Firstly, I see that they are not as necessary as I once thought. When I inserted them I was not aware of another reference that would do the job I wanted. That no longer seems the case. As has been openly discussed,copies of the book were sent to editors of the article, Skip included, because I enjoyed the cameraderie of collaborative editing - even when there was the occasional tiff.

3fe4393addcc62f4,"This page is dedicated to the Gnome Owl.
MEASUREMENTS: The Northern Pygmy-Owl has a body length of 7 - 8 inches, a wingspan of 15 - 16 inches, and weighs about 2 - 2 1/2 ounces.  
HABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  
DIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. 
REPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  
NAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. 
INTERESTING FACTS: 
Unlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.

Since pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah, they really exist. You need at least one w-3 (one FA from that class) and one w-6 (one from that class) and you can make the others from them (a few carnivores species need more). Essential fatty acid deficiency was first seen in people getting total intravenous nutrition, where, for obvious reasons they put in only amino acids, sugar, vitamins and minerals (fat emulsions were quite hard to develop as IV formulas). The reason for the problem is that the body can make facts but cannot introduce unsaturation closer to the end than w-9, and you NEED w-6 and w-3 fatty acids to make lipids (the w-3 DHA is your most common neural tissue fat).  I'll see what I can do to put in some general refs from academic nutrition books. There is some quackery out there (like pills that contain w-9 because olive oil is cheap) but most of the fish oil supplements are worth taking, actually, unless you eat cold water ocean fish regularly.  BTW, there is some evidence that that bad reputation of saturated fats are from experiments in which animals were fed only hydrogenated coconut oil for their fat source. This destroys all essential fatty acids because it destroys all PUFAs. On such a diet, even DOGS get severe atherosclerosis, and they are species highly resistant to it (their HDLs are higher than their LDLs). So all this is quite fascinating.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Opening Bias 

In the opening segment (If that's what you call it - I mean the first content, before the table of contents), there is the following paragraph:

The conflict killed at least 1,200 people, mostly Lebanese citizens,[38][39][40] severely damaged Lebanese civil infrastructure, and displaced approximately one million Lebanese[41] and 300,000–500,000 Israelis.[26][42][43] After the ceasefire, some parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexploded cluster bomblets.[44]

It is blatantly obvious how anti-Israeli this paragraph is. The information might be true, and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is, but the way in which it is organized, especially in the opening segment, is ridiculously biased. A reader would probably read it whilst skimming the article, as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment, and then get the following information: Israel killed many Lebanese citizens; Lebanese civil infrastructure, which means hospitals, roads, etc., was destroyed by Israel, Israel displaced twice as much Lebanese civilians, and they used cluster bombs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable.

Completely biased. Completely anti-Israeli. Completely ridiculous. Completely unacceptable of a Wikipedia article, especially a """"good"""" article.

I recommend either changing the wording (Maybe removing 'mostly Lebanese citizens', 'Lebanese', and changing it to approximately 1.5 million people displaced, as well as completely omitting the last sentence). The entire paragraph could be removed entirely, with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs.

I didn't make a personal attack, first of all.

I didn't make any personal attacks, I made a general statement that Anime Fans who think that Anime is culturally relevant to anyone but them really need to grow up.  I justified that by stating that even in its country of origin, it's irrelevant and viewed as immature Children's Programming.
Second, I think I did make my case.  Self-censorship is not actually censorship.

Hi Jim,

I see that you have deleted the page of Research Institute for Geo-Hydrological Protection for Unambiguous advertising or promotion.
This is strange in my opinion since the institute is not a company or a business agency but a research public institute so we really do not need to advertise anyone or to promote something. 
Our institute is like this: Istituto per le applicazioni del calcolo or like this: Institut de l'information scientifique et technique 
Our page is only more detailed. May I ask you to explain me why the page has to be deleted and and also how we can improve it in order to be more compliant with wikipedia?

External Memory
I believe that the External Memory section should be broken into two separate sections or more firmly defined within the same section. One on """"Self Identity"""" and using external objects to identify one's self, and """"External Memory"""" being stored memories and information. Here are my reasons.

Self Identity:
In """"Stand Alone Complex"""" Episode 25, Batou says to Kusunagi about her watch """"No matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through, this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you, right? In this time that's far too fleeting, people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. For you, isn't that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person you've been up until now?""""

This says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. As biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. In the GiTS universe, that is not true and you must tie your self-identity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. There are references in SAC 2ng Gig Episode 8 about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. In SAC 2nd Gig Episode 11 there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. All of these """"external mnemonic devices"""" are used to trigger memories in one's self, but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.

External Memory:
External Memory is exactly that, memories and experiences that are stored """"offline"""" onto a hard disk or such. If you posses a cyber brain, there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. Since there is an electronic separation, the signals received from the senses (touch, taste, etc.) can be recorded and replayed at any given time. Thus, you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. Your external senses turn off, and you’re fed recorded sensory information. Better than any video camera recording, your feeling the heat of the sun, the breeze, your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger, etc. Storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. This would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use; fully immersive gaming and movies, virtual business meetings that feel completely real, instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. In SAC 2ng Gig Ep 23, Batou talks about using Kusunagi's external memories to keep Gohda talking in Ep 22. He also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding Kuze. In SAC Ep 10 Ishikawa experiences Batou's memories from the murder scene. SAC Ep 21 the whole team replays Togusa's memories from the Sunflower Society office when he was shot.

Iranian V Persian
I see you asked about this on the Wiki Project Iran talkpage. Iranian, originally meant the Iranian peoples, which are a number of ethnic groups including the Persian people. The Iranian sate was named after the Iranian people and many dynasty's that ruled Iran historicly were not ethnically Persinal at all. Despite being known as Iran internally, for it's entire history, the Greeks refered to the country as Persia, in reference to the country's most important ethnic group at the time and this name was later adopted by the Roman's and then used throughotu the West until 1936 when Reza Shah got the Western states to officially recognise the country's name as Iran. Now although, in today's world """"Iranian"""" most commonly refers to citizen of Iran and """"Persian"""" to the ethnic group Persian people (not all of which are from Iran, since there are milions of ethnic Presians in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), with the term """"Iranic"""" being commonly used to refer to the """"Iranian Peoples"""" in the sense of all these different ethnic groups (Persians, Pashtuns, Kurds, Baluchis, ect.), however, due to wikipedia policies of English being Wikipedia's language here, Iran historicly is being refered to as the """"Persian Empire"""" or """"Persia"""" (which is infact a region in Iran), it's citizens as """"Persians"""" (although many of the notable Iranian citizens of the past weren't ethnic Persians and infact none of the kings of the """"Persian"""" empire from 1501 (re-establishment of Iranian state) until 1979 (abolishment of monarchy) were ethnic Persians) and so on wikipedia Iranian individuals prior to 1936 are refered to as Persians and Iran is refered to as Persia in articles concerning pre-1936 history.

Yes well, with Timbouctou blocked by the admins we may actually do so.
I find your claims very possible, but again, what is required are reliable sources, not claims. Even if we assume you are correct in that this was the """"first"""" flag used after the HDZ came to power, this is not what we're looking for. What we are looking for is the flag that was predominantly in (official) use. I.e. even if the white-square-flag was used the first time, which I admit was likely the case, that does not necessarily mean that it is the version of the flag that was used afterwards in any significant measure - particularly since the Croatian government very soon afterward adopted an official flag with the red-square-first chequy (to distance itself from Ustase symbolism).

To be perfectly frank, the lack of sources here makes discussion very arbitrary and difficult. I mean who really knows which version was more commonly used? And I understand there probably are no sources on this. However, the WP:BURDEN of evidence lies with the editor who introduced the disputed changes, i.e. yourself. So I really don't know what to do other than to again ask you whether you have some real reliable sources that support your edit?  (TALK) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Wikipedia Ambassador update! 

Hi! You're getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you're interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. 

You may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.

Another major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.

If you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you're no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don't need to do anything.

Please do these steps as soon as possible
First, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we'll get you set up as quickly as possible.

Once you've got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:
Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile
Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile

Going forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).

After that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists """"Current"""" courses, but you can change the Status filter to """"Planned"""" to see courses for this term that haven't reached their listed start date yet.)

As this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we'd love to have your help!) Please reach out to me (Sage Ross) with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.

Communication and keeping up to date
In the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We're trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:
 The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.
 The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.
 If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.

Ambassador training and resources
We now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.)

Please go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where t",0,0,0,0,0,0

654c5127a4232a53,"United Kingdom
I think the United Kingdom itself maybe be emerging to be an early 21st century super power with the US as the world hyper power. Here's the reasons for me thinking this:
Second to the US in world diplomacy
Second highest defence budget
Second largest navy in terms of tonnage
Second most power projection capability
Second largest aircraft carrier fleet with second largest aircraft carries being built after the Nimitz aircraft carriers
UN Security Council seat and founding member
Head of the Commonwealth of Nations (the largest organisation of states after the UN)
The British monarch is also Head of State of 15 other countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
Major player in NATO and EU
Large North Sea oil and gas production
London being one of the greatest cities in the world 
City of London being the world's main financial centre in terms of number of amount of money that passes through it each year and largest gathering of financial groups.
Pound Sterling one of the world's top currencies alongside US Dollar and Euro
Second highest growth for major developed economies after US.
Its own nuclear missiles on nuclear submarines which have joint longest range with US nuclear submarines
Largest number of over seas territories
Carried out major invasions of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. 
Was only the nation to actually invade Afghanistan and Iraq alongside US forces (Other forces came after US & UK forces had secured the countries)
Second largest force in Iraq and Afghanistan 
Leads the fight against Afghan rebels in Helmand province
Controls southern Iraq and large areas of Afghanistan
Leads NATO force in Kosovo
The leading nation in tackling global warming
A leading country in the Middle East road map to peace
Most involved in Darfur issue
Second most involved in Iran nuclear issue
Single handedly resolved Sierra Leone issue
I think since the end of the Cold War to present the United Kingdom has played the second largest role in the world after the United States, and after all the role a country plays in the world is what defines a super power. Also the United Kingdom demonstrated that it can single handedly and quickly defeat a regional power and quickly resolve a conflict when it won the Falklands War. This is more than what can be said for such countries as the United States or Former Soviet Union. After the Second World War and during the 1950s the United Kingdom was considered to be a super power because of the role it played in the world but the after effect of the Suez crisis made this disappear. The Falklands war and Thatcher-Reagen era displayed the UK was preparing to retrieve its status as being on the same level as the USA and USSR. Soon after this the Cold War ended and with no Soviet Union left to counter the United Kingdom in any way (like in the Suez crisis) the Thatcher-Reagen duo had worked and the United Kingdom set in motion activities to reclaim such a postion it had in the world that it had in the world before the Suez crisis in time for the beginning of the 21st century. The 1990s was a bit of a prelude to today and saw the United Kingdom slowly begin to prepare as being a power equal to the US and former USSR by being eager to greatly contribute to the Gulf War and and Yugoslav wars and grew more involed in Western Africa by sending troops there to resolve conflict in Sierra Leone and was testing its place as second most powerful in the world to the US and in being a semi super power again. Soon afterwards September 11th happened and the War on Terror that followed gave the United Kingdom just what it needed to reassert itself on the world stage and came just at the right time to have given the United Kingdom time to perpare and try out its future after the end of the Cold War and for the beginning of the 21st century. Today the United Kingdom is easily seen as being second most powerful on the world stage diplomatically and even militarily and could be called a semi super power. People have started to raise this issue called the British Moment in the 21st century. The United Kingdom also acts very much as a deciding force in NATO and the EU in which policy they take or their futures in whether it decides to side with the US or EU and can have an effect around the world. It also greatly influences the other 52 members of the Commonwealth of Nations which it heads by its monarch and is the largest body other than the UN. Not to mention its influence and veto power of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",0,0,0,0,0,0

In response. 1)Yes, I agree that there is a perception of overlap between ALSF, the yl's and so forth. This perception however is an inaccurate one. One only need do factiva searches on the hostility between alsf and the yl's in the 1980's and 1990's for instance. Indeed in some states liberal students and young liberals have nothign to do with each other still. In contrast to the YL's, the ALSF is not considered part of the Liberal Party, and the party has no authority over it. If you have any suggestions as to how I can make this clearer on the ALSF page, I shall be more than happy to take this on board. 2)Stating that the YL's and Liberal Students in NSW have worked together and held joint functions does nothing to counteract what i just said. I fail to see the relevance. Furthermore, we're talking about joint functions between the NSW Liberal Students Association and the YL's, not alsf. 3)Most importantly, what on earth does this have to do with the issue at hand, regarding Macquarie Uni?

The initial criticism was that Stringer should be added as a source. It appears nobody follows this Talk page who has the expertise in anthropology (nor even the common sense) to comprehend that Stringer is an expert source who should be added to this article and it is now a badly-outdated article, as no valid challenges have been brought forth that would exclude Stringer's opinion from Wikipedia articles (and despite the very long period given to Wikipedians to challenge it), and thus:

I concur that this article should be unlocked, because, for example, see also my request for another year-old source to be updated, which is crucial as it is in the lede, and claiming that the RAO hypothesis is still the mainstream hypothesis in human evolution, when even those anthropologists who are cited as calling it the """"mainstream"""" hypothesis have retracted that claim and you are therefore basically misinforming a new generation of K-12 students, year-by-year, as you've kept this page outdated since 2010. It is obvious that no Wikipedians with expertise in anthropology have editing-rights to this locked article and are being responsible enough to maintain this article since approximately 2010, not even responsible enough to add simple {update} and {POV dispute} types of tags.

  My name is Subramanian ( Subbu for short). It is only recently that I came to know that AYikudi Bala Subramanyar, of the village Ayikudi, near Tenkasi, near Tirunelveli is our Kula Deivam.

For example the temple tank and surroundings need some real cleaning. The temple also needs some face lift. SO this mail is an attempt to first get hold of all like minded people who have visited this temple and those who value this temple highly either because of ancestral liks or otherwise. In a way this is an attempt to create a commuinty and later on we can decide collectively on what can be done.

I've reverted to the version that is in line with IMOS.

The proper place for that discussion is at the IMOS talk page, not here.

By way of disclosure, I'm very sceptical of anon IP addresses and a new editor turning up making contentious edits in an area that has, in the past, attracted much edit warring and resulted in many blocked editors and the uncovering of sock accounts.  The editing style shown is reminiscent of those times, in my opinion, and the community has a low tolerence for this behaviour.  I'm trying not to let my scepticism get in the way, but for that to happen, I'd like to see some meaningful engagement on the topic of *this article*, and why *this article* should get special treatment and not follow IMOS.  ++   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits - both organisations are openly anti-Israeli (and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such). I merely pointed this out.

2818e7fb08ab9c28,""":::: But in what sense can that comment possibly be “correct”? """"Provided that what is sourced is already in the article""""! I can't let that pass, as it is just so damaging - so I'm going to say a few things. You cannot just ‘summarise’ any old group of citations (sometime creating a new thing altogether in doing so - which is excempt from needing proof) – you are absolutely obliged to consider WP:weight, along with other of the many guidelines like WP:red flag in Verifiability, and Notability too. Weight alone will more often than not dictate the new text, as it has done now. 

These retentive methods of ‘Style reviewing’ are a plague across the full scope of Wikipedia, and this article highlights the foolishness (too long maintained) of methodically tick-boxing inherently illogical style-correctness, whilst routinely (ie as a kind of 'policy') ignoring content( which is ironically seen as the job of the editors, who actually get sidelined in the process). In teh past I've seen so many foolish paragraphs pass though ‘style’, even in Featured Articles (another content-shy process believe it or not). There really is nothing clever about being so clinical when it leads to plain misrepresentation, especially with a subject like this. Many non-British would will be mislead by the text on a basic ‘reader’ level here anyway, which just adds more irony to the process of course . As a rule, it is good to consider what you are doing in life in anyway, regardless of your job.

What happened in Nick Griffin is that simple event-verifying  citations from within the article (the few cases of Griffin being invited to speak at mainstream establishments) were converted into a kind of super-flexible ‘source’ material’, which (in that new state) were easily moulded into the stand-alone line """"Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""" I strongly suspect that no one got a shoe-in to actually add any weight, due to the rigid system involved - where new  content is demoted in value, and even at times discouraged. I’ve seen it happen too often, it’s just plain dumb. What’s worse, a general ethos of ‘protecting the result’ comes from the process, which ended here in me being accused of ‘vandalism’ for attempting change, which I really object to. It really is dumb.

Imagine someone collecting a handful of citations of various people expressing an opinion (shall we say of black people being inferior to whites?) and places them in a relevant section in an article (say a """"Controversy"""" section in a new and developing article called """"Racism"""") . According to Wikipedia’s Style Council, this line inserted at the end of the intro would theoretically be fine: """"Many people believe that black people are inferior to whites”. As there was nothing in the developing article about the many issues surrounding IQ test and the reading of them both past and present, no balance is made, and the Intro passes with flying colours. The new authorised version is then considered as ‘passing consensus’ – a broadly finished thing that is duly protected from change.

The Intro equation I’ve seen many times is: X (citations of comments existing somewhere i n the article) = Z (a new flexible ‘source’ material  when grouped) = Y (a new and uncited statement of fact, based on the new entity of the ‘source’). THE INNER WORKINGS OF ‘SUMMARY’ ARE SIMPLY NOT APPARENT TO THE TYPICAL WIKIPEDIA READER, who is always at the very bottom of the Wikipedia heap, just below the general editor.

Articles like Nick Griffin can be difficult and need creative work on the edit level - but that is the point. So much time on Wikipedia is wasted on stylising incomplete articles and weak unbalanced text. It is no way to bypass edit conflict - that ‘’’has’’’ to be done the hard way, such as in finding ways to express weight. Risking edit battles is far superior to squeezing down to make-shift style-approved articles that are subsequently protected from change. Here that process made the introduction bland, weak and misleading, and the added factor of the subject's inherent extremity ensured the article became seriously misleading – to the point that the article became Nick Griffin-friendly, and hence ultimate",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ah, apologies that my response was not as helpful as I would've liked for it to have been.  With regards to my previous editing habits, not much as changed.  I work on similar (in lots of cases, the same) articles as I did previously.  My primary article writing foci has shifted a bit, however, from sport to literature.  With regards to admin actioning, I've never been hugely active, and hasn't changed much, either.  My primary focus in that area is working with OTRS.  With regards to views about Wikipedia, that encompasses a great deal, but I'd be happy to answer any specific questions.  With regards to previous concerns about me in the past, I honestly cannot think of anything significant; I changed my username for reasons completely unrelated to anything controversial on Wikipedia.  Upon writing this, I'm not sure that this is exactly what you're looking for, as I've offered these comments completely devoid of prior references and diffs and such, for reasons I'm sure you can understand (but not totally agree with, which is fine, of course).

About your improvements; good work, in general. I am still feeling lost about the description of Henry Cow's music being 'intense', a change from 'intensities'. Any music can be 'intense' for an aficionado. Me, I think Frith is intense. D ... Something more descriptive is needed.
Regarding the presence of Beppe Colli, I do not see his notability, and the web magazine Clouds and Clocks is not mentioned elsewhere, by other media sources. When I Google """"clouds and clocks"""", I get a 1965 lecture on rationality by Sir Karl Raimund Popper, and I get a children's book on encopresis, the soiling of pants. Similarly, Beppe Colli does not get mentioned elsewhere. The man and the website are not notable.
Applying the same criteria to Babyblaue Seiten and the German reviewer Achim Breiling, I find that Breiling is a medical researcher who has published papers about genes, proteins and cloning, and has written prog rock reviews for the New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Music in addition to a bunch of them at Babyblaue. CDBaby lists Babyblaue Seiten as a source, and an article exists about that review site in the German Wikipedia. It looks like Breiling in Babyblaue is somewhat more reliable a source than Colli in Clouds. Although Colli's observations are interesting, I cannot see keeping them. It's too bad, because he is the only reviewer who hinted at the CD having some loudness war characteristics, a step down from the dynamic spaciousness of the LP.
About the """"bursts with"""" quote from van Peer, the word 'eradicates' was wrong. Van Peer wrote 'eradiates', which is not a word, but he may have intended this construction as a neologism.

 Proper use 

The adjustable spanner#Proper use section of this article still seems to be self-contradictory.

I found one discussion  that has some physics-based arguments that I found pretty persuasive.
One commenter says that the preferred way to use a pipe wrench is the opposite direction from the preferred way to use an adjustable wrench,
which may explain why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

Norm Abram, in """"Adjustable Wrench"""",
implies that (unlike a basin wrench) an adjustable wrench often works adequately even when turned the """"wrong way"""", such as when doing the """"flip trick"""".
This may also contribute to why so many people disagree on the """"proper"""" direction to turn it.

What exactly is the advantage of turning it the """"right"""" way versus the """"wrong"""" way?
Too often I hear that turning it the """"wrong"""" way is """"more likely to round off the corners"""" without any more details,
but I prefer an explanation that would make it possible to work out from first principles which way is the """"right"""" way.
(I wouldn't be surprised to discover that there are advantages to each direction).

We agree that there are human rights that do not appear in any law book, treaty, dictionary, or even a USSC decision. The founders of the US said this, and wrote an expandible constitution.

 I have  read various pieces by Dr Mehdi Khaz'ali and listened to various  interviews with him, and must say that he comes over as a fantasist. He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in Kirkuk,  Iraq, amongst members of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan or Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq  - both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of Maku  and Khoy  (West Azarbaijan Province has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of Kurdistan,  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been """"at the front"""" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places? As I  said earlier, Mehdi Khaz'ali is just a fantasist who seems to believe  in his own fantasies (there are some videos on YouTube  in which he says things that no one in his position could possibly  know).

Turkey also has influences on areas not considered part of the historical middle east such as Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, etc. Again exclusively adding a Geographical location to the Term Regional Power for Turkey is nothing but Euro-centric racism. Turkey is regionally considered middle Eastern by most countries regardless of including the statement. The statement was put there so others wont think that a country like Turkey could possibly have influence on a continent like Europe. By adding that, one is implying that Turkey isn't good enough to influence Europe even though no one is claiming it does. It is also making sure no one assumes Turkey is anything but Middle Eastern.

I'm indifferent. I have work to do on-wiki, but I also have plenty to do off-wiki. If you believe that the welfare of the project will be better served by an unblock, then consider yourself free to do it, within what is allowed as to reversing administrative decisions. Probably Future Perfect should be consulted, unless there is consensus that his block was involved (notice the dispute section above, and if more information is needed  that section was not accompanied by evidence about the existing dispute because I didn't want to write it as the first approach. But, if asked to do so, I would.)

Please do not unblock me if it would cause more disruption than it would prevent; the block will expire in a week anyway and delaying unblock that long is not likely to cause serious harm. On the other hand, comment on the propriety of the block is welcome here, and there is also an open RfAr/Clarification. I had filed that, and it was over comment in it that I was blocked. Possibly I should have a transcluded section there, in my section of the RfAr, and I'm going to need guidance from ArbComm as to any limits to be placed on what I can say there.

Hi JacoPlame - The picture of Johann Hari that you agreed to post has now been given the correct copyright-free status at flickr:

It turns out the picture of Hari currently on the article is not actually him (I e-mailed him, and he looked at it and informed me of this - see the discussion page) so as soon as you could correct it, that would be great.

It's probably best not to unfreeze the page though.

I think there is a misunderstanding on what a """"tactical"""" victory is. It does not mean a victory of tactical formation, but rather a """"success in battle without substantive or long-lasting gain"""", as opposed to a [[strategic victory which is """"a success in a military campaign"""". If one sets ones sights low enough, and claim the goal of the operation was merely to establish a bridgehead, then it was a clear Soviet victory. However I seriously doubt the goal was only to gain a bridgehead, but rather to punch through the Panther Line, which the Soviets clearly failed to do. While the overall campaign was a clear strategic victory for the Soviets because they won the campaign in the end, it was a tactical victory for the Germans because they were successful in holding Narva even though it was not long lasting, i.e. six months.

   Hi.  I'm not familiar with Doyle or the topic in general, but perhaps I can give you a sense of whether there should/shouldn't be an article on Doyle. With biographies of living people, there are two hurdles on this Wiki, and they largely overlapverifiability and notability. In both cases, usually the question boils down to this:  are there enough reliable, secondary sources that tell us about the subject that we can read them all, and from those sources alone write a reasonably neutral and factual article? In general such sources are going to be things like newspaper articles, magazine articles and books from reliable publishers, anything with a real editorial staff. No press releases, no use of the fellow's own web site, Facebook page, videos, etc.  For athletes like this it's also possible to fill in additional information from reliable databases of results, but notability really requires articles that discuss the subject in some level of detail. Take a look at [{WP:GNG]], and see if that helps you decide.  looks to be at least one such source,  is a reliable reference but only mentions Doyle in passing. Of the 5 sources listed on streetstunts, 4 are don't meet these requirements, and the fifth might or might notI can't tell since the page is dead.  Looks from what I can tell """"borderline"""" with respect to our policies, but since you know the subject in more detail than I do (or at least I assume so) you probably know of specific resources I'm unaware of that might help flesh out the article.

Nice Pic
Ah good old Max Schreck... talk

I'm not really happy with that picture; its low resolution doesn't work well in the size I'm using on my userpage.  But I have to work, and don't have time to search for a better Halloween picture, so Schreck it is.  It is a cool picture; I just wasn't expecting it to pixellate quite as much as it did. - (talk · contribs) 

Seen the movie, met the director, met the star, eaten at the restaurant with the extra-garlic shawarma.   
I have totally added that movie to my Netflix queue. - (talk · contribs) 

Wish I could provide more feedback than that, the memory of the film has been washed from my mind.  I do remember the shawarma though, a very tasty shawarma indeed.  My tastes run more towards teenage sweedish lesbians and boy meets girl, boy beats girl.  Incidentally, I love the poster on the latter page, so perhaps I lack the moral authority to criticize Creepy Crawler.   
I have seen, and loved, both of those movies. - (talk · contribs) 
Secretary was a fantastic movie.  I've not seen Fucking Åmål, but I think I shall.  Shawarma is OK, but I've always been more partial to a nice lamb kafta sandwich with tahini and pickles or Shanklish, olive oil, mint, and cucumber on pita. talk 
My girlfriend has an insane aversion to garlic so I rarely get to indulge in Middle-Eastern cuisine.  I've considered leaving her over this matter, but who would pay her half of the rent? It's a tough decision, garlic versus rent, one that I take very seriously.  FA was really just a very conventional teen romance movie, but with lesbians instead of heterosexuals.  Think The Breakfast Club, but with two characters, both with breasts.  Secretary was instrumental in helping me realize that James Spader wasn't a douche, though I wouldn't go out of my way to see any of his movies past or present.   
Indeed.  I used to live very close to the ByTowne Cinema in Ottawa, which contributed towards my excellent taste.  Now I live much further away and sadly the last movie I watched was Blades of Glory.  I was drunk at the time.  Now I'm sober, and filled with shame.   
I stumbled onto FA one night and couldn't turn away.  Something magnetic going on there.  |seriously|folks

 Final Fantasy (video game) 

I was wondering about two things regarding the article:
As the article is essentially about the original game, it's pretty much assumed that the gameplay and plot sections refers to the NES version's gameplay. Therefore I believe """"(NES version)"""" in the caption of the first two images in the body are unnecessary, while the image of the WSC version needs to state that it's from the WSC version.
There are several parentheses throughout the plot section that confuse me. Example: """"Lefeinish (Lufenian)"""". I think it refers to the original name, and to the name used in later versions in parenthesis, but I'm not sure. Anyway, if I'm correct, I think the parentheses can be removed, based on my first comment. A hidden note could also be added, telling the reader that the name's refer to the original game.

 Justanother 
Hey! I'm glad you wrote me. This guy is exactly the kind of person I do not like. I don't know where to begin describing everything that is wrong with him. I can see it in the replies to you as well. L.Ron's military career, if it is fabricated, is obviously worth discussing. I don't know why it would be fabricated, it wouldn't change my opinion of him or anythiing, so many times things aren't what they seem, but it's still worth looking into. It isn't 'he said, she said', it can be figured out what the truth is. And he says anything else is PR. This is what bugs me about justanother, he says things like they are fact. NO, it isn't just PR. It could be that he lied, it could be that there was a mistake, etc. That isn't PR.

Ok, now I'm reading the posts on yourpage. This is so hard to understand. You're not supposed to talk about Scientology with him, he says? """"Is that clear""""? See,he speaks to people with an air of superiority, like he is the voice of reason, of authority.""""And I have no doubt that you consider yourself the soul of equanimity and justice."""" COMPLETE PROJECTION. 

Whoa, I'm on the Barbara Schwarz page, he did this with me to. I don't understand those people who feel the need to inform you of obvious thigns you would never do like you need them to inform you otherwise you would do it. He did that to me at first when we were friendly regarding editing Scientology pages (telling me not to do this or that, which I would never have done). 

I think the good thing is that this is just the internet. If it were real life, we would be able to tell in a second what was up with this guy and we wouldn't apply him the same weight that we apply other people. I sometimes forget that when I use the net because you're not getting the feel of the person saying the weird thing. It used to bug me some of the things that critics of Scientology used to say, and then I saw photos and video of them, and it made sense. You could tell they weren't really there, so I wasn't upset anymore. I'd love to see what this guy looks like. I'd probably end up feeling sorry for him and have compassion and overlook all the incredibly rude traits he has. 

I don't know how to explain how things got bad between us. It's just his personality, who he is, and I disagree iwth it, find it incredibly rude and invalidating to other people, and just let him know. 

 You're on the Scientology's 'enemies' list? What happened? You defintely didn't imply anythiing negative about Scientology, it's all good.

Another thing about Anynobdoy, is he DOES seem like everything is pro-Scientology, no matter what, and I've noticed that with some Scientologists, but that's not me, and that's wrong. I dislike a lot of Scientologists I've met because I can tell the kind of people they are and the kinds of things that they would do or think, and I'm just not okay with that. Scientology isn't some group that you join and become this ideal Scientologist and just turn into that. It's like when I go to the gym. I don't adapt the feeling and personality of the gym and the people in the gym. I go there to work my body, to use it as a tool. I do the same thing with Scientology. I really hate when people do that because what starts happening is they start feeling like they're better than others because they """"act"""" more like an ideal Scientologist than people who aren't doing that, and all sorts of other things, which I think our friend here might've done.  )

 Cite Example? 

If you have some sort of idea why editing the """"Roman Polanski"""" to include the title of rapist is disruptive or vandalism you should explain why instead of just unilaterally deciding that it is. You should cite more than just you think it is and explain specifically why you think that it is. There are many other Wikipedia articles that are very similar with respect to people who are known for many different things, one of which is some sort of criminal act or acts. These articles include titles like, rapist, criminal, pedophile, murderer, thief, organized crime boss and many others. Just look at the OJ Simpson article, it makes reference to accusations against him for murder in the first sentence. Where this title is seems to be at issue for some reason. Wikipdeia articles are usually vastly different in their writing style and sometimes titles are places in different places throughout the articles. Since there is no debate as to whether Roman Polanski is a rapist or not, and since it is the one thing major thing he is known for outside of his movie career should it not be included in the first sentence? Is there a specific guideline as to where in an article a specific title that someone has earned throughout their life should be placed? Should a person's most prominent title be their career, their ethnicity, place of origin, or some other adjective that describes a notable feature of their life? What specific guideline specifies this? Should it merely be what the person is best known for, because Roman Polanski is very well known for having raped a 13 year old girl and for being a movie director. Many people would say he is not known for his acting as he has few notable roles, or writing as he has written very little, but these titles appear in the first sentence of his article.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Others have reinstated my close twice now, which I'm perfectly fine with.  I'm more than willing to defend the close if need be.  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought.  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert.  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.  If I read the comments and thought a consensus might be reached one way or another, I wouldn't have closed it.

Plagiarism is not copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different transgressions.

Cajuns, acadians, louisianans, they're so many different names for different americans of french descent because their culture is so rich and somewhat so different but so close at the same time. I'm an acadian but more importantly I'm a french american so I really don't see why there should be a difference. 

If you say there should be two different list, it doesn't make sense. The people on the french-american list should be in one of wiki-invented list of cajuns or acadians. I understand there are some more recent french-americans who are only 1 or 2 generations-old americans but this distinction isn't made for italian-americans, german-americans. I'm surprised to see Albert Einstein a fairly recent immigrant in American history next to Katherine Heigl, a 10 to 12 generations american. \\

c67e85f16fe77b50,"Notable alumni ==

This section badly needs cleaning up. I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support, here, first. A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately.

To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please.   

I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met.   

I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on.

How does the language of the Franks, which is known more or less from place names and personal names only plus a few borrowed words, tell us anything about their ethnicity? We knew they were Germanic before that. Are you implying that there is a connection between Dutch and Frankish """"ethnicity""""? That connection, though it is probably there, is not very direct over a thousand five hundred years...
I don't know why the fact that a Frankish-derived language (Dutch) being spoken in a certain region (the Netherlands) should force us to believe that the Franks were originally from there. Of course the two facts are related, but the fact of the language being spoken there does not itself tell us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Franks any more than the fact that a Latin-derived language is spoken in Belgium tells us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Romans. Again, I understand the connection, but it is not made on linguistic analysis alone. This is why most books/articles on the Franks that I've read (Wallace-Hadrill, Bachrach) don't mention Dutch. Your comment about Franci seniores (what does the Franci superiores have to do with anything?) does nothing to explain to me the importance of their language. Their well-attested written language was Latin. Why not mention that? In fact, it tells us far more about the Franks than that they spoke a proto-Dutch language. 
As to the remarks concerning the pertinence of my comments only for the Merovingian period, I was not aware that the article was about the development of a language and not about the Franks, a term which does not have a consistent universal ethnic/tribal meaning by the end of the 9th century (and probably by the end of the 8th). 
In short, I don't see how you have actually answered the objection. I don't know what """"German"""" point of view you think I have, but I find that ridiculous. And shouldn't a minority of scholarship moreso undermine your """"Dutch"""" point of view? Finally, when did I declare myself a Carolingian specialist? I have no specialty.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which Mr 4meter4 such anxiously protects. In England, Italy or Spain 16th century were described entirely different types of falsettos. On the top of it, Mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto, or the falsetto of Ian Gillan. Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto. What about Michael Kiske? Is it not falsetto? Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do (did) not sing falsetto? Does any of these falsettos sound breathy? Not to me. Isn't out there published a note about those? Maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it. Why? It would not fit to his article. He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk. 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World.

“Savage proved that, if you adhere to axioms of rationality,  if you believe an uncertain event has possible outcomes  each with a utility to you of  then your choices can be explained as arising from a function in which you believe that there is a subjective probability of each outcome is , and your subjective expected utility is the expected value of the utility…”

“Savage's response was not that this showed a flaw in his method, rather that applying his method allowed individuals to improve their decision making.”

The first paragraph claims a descriptive role for the theory, but according to the second quote it is a normative theory about how people should reason.

I think it should be pointed out in the article that Klezmer is """"influenced"""" and heavily borrowed from Balkan and other music of that region of our planet. 

If you were to watch an older Ukrainian or Moldovan or Bulgarian movie, you'd think the background music is Klezmer... Incidentally, like with so many other things Jewish - The Israeli national anthem isn't """"Jewish"""" at all, but an old Italian song, if I'm not mistaken, with Hebrew lyrics. Btw, Hebrew is an artificially revived language. Up until last century it was like Latin - a dead language, used only in religion (which needs to die too). And then it was artificially resuscitated by Zionists.

I've been too busy to take part in that debate, but I see that this has in any case been pre-empted by User:Kotniski who has created and populated the """":Category:Constituent countries of the United Kingdom"""". In my opinion this is unacceptable as 
1) the debate mentioned by Dai is still in progress, and
2) the new category name has the rejected term """"constituent countries"""" and is therefore contrary to a decision reached after a long discussion and contradicts the main article's name (Countries of the United Kingdom) and the term found in most other relevant articles. 
Personally, I don't see why Wales et al should not be categoried as 'European countries'. I am certainly against this unilateral reversion to a contentious and rarely used term that has been rejected here. I'm also somewhat suspicious as to what is going on here. This all started as the results of edits by a """"new"""" contributor, TDSDOS (who seems remarkably familiar with wikipedia editing and terminology) whose few edits thus far are mainly concerned with the status of the three countries of Britain (and a bit of Ireland). Then we have the unilateral creation of this category. Am I the only one who thinks this is more than fortuitous? Be that as it may, this new category is not acceptable and a consensus decision would also be needed for the logical alternative, i.e. 'Countries of the United Kingdom', if the need for it is proven and accepted.

2c11412908449ee1,"The Malvern Water cure
For what it's worth, I concur that the Malvern Water article benefitted from the exercise. To me, the best indicator that (User:Jerem43 was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. 

There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page citations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare.

The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. How one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpires - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructively criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. A funny old world indeed, what with that and the irony that the Malvern Water cure still seems to be working its magic!   Wotnow",0,0,0,0,0,0

Your inability to admit facts in the face of overwhelming evidence

Well if the shoe fits and the logic lacks, then you are laughing at your own lack of logic in your previous and last contributions to the NWPL deletion page.    
   
You refuse to acknowledge overwhelming evidence. No sources say the NWPL was not responsible for having Sparks recognized, contrary to what you said. Conclusion: you are making things up. Stop misleading yourself and Wikipedia readers.   
    
If your research skills are not limited, then your understanding of the facts, or willingness to read what I have provided, is.    
   
Have you not read the study on park origins? What part of it don't you understand? If the NWPL was not responsible for the recognition of Sparks, then I challenge you, honestly with facts to support your argument, to demonstrate who was.    
   
Below are two more articles to convince you of your egregious error, dare I say fabulation?   
   
If you are not serving wikipedia's purpose of informing the public, then whose interest are you serving?   
   
I dare you to continue denying the facts. Go ahead...   

I note that you and other editors of Gatineau Park material are aviation enthusiasts...

     
 
- Sparks was founder of the park, researcher says,    
- By Dave Rogers, Ottawa Citizen, May 9, 2004, p. A9   
- Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park, but an ex-journalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force, Dave Rogers reports.   
- The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park.   
- The evidence, gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter Jean-Paul Murray, suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park.   
- Mr. Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park.   
- During the 1930s, Mr. Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the area's scenic beauty. The government created Gatineau Park in 1938, but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park.   
- Mr. Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952. The plan recommended that all private property in the area, including his home, be expropriated. Mr. Sparks' vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr. Murray, the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner.   
- There was no electricity or combustible material, other than the building itself, to create a fire risk, nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods.   
- No cause for the fire was ever made public. The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank. There was no cause, no suspects and no investigation.   
- An obituary on Mr. Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 called him the “father of the Gatineau Park,” adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, he “brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park.”   
- Born in 1880, where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today, Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the King-Byng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government. Mr. Sparks' contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the park's founder.   
- “Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie King's government in 1926,” Mr. Murray said. """"He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans.   
- Mr. Murray said Mr. King was cautious about the creation of the park. “I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937, a few months before the park was created, that showed he wasn't enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property.”   
- “The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park, but this disproves it.”   
- Mr. Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr. Sparks' role in creating the park so people wouldn't be tempted to advocate it",0,0,0,0,0,0

Edit warring? Show me where! Because I was not.  

Rlevse, you really are a racist you know. Also, I'm Not even an Arab! lol Furthermore, Do not put words in my mouth. GOT IT?? Your just so blinded by your hatred its incredible and laughable. )   
If you look at the history of the article, you can see that you repeatedly undid others' edits despite there being no conesnsus for your edit. That is edit warring. When there is no consensus for your version, the correct procedure is to restore the article to the status quo, discuss the issue, and change the article again only if you gain consensus for your edits. Furthermore, comments such as the above are unconstructive and are not conducive to a positive atmosphere.   

Firstly, I would really like to thank you for your kind response here! ) As for me calling Rlevse """"racist"""", that's what it looks like from the way he seems obsessed with keeping out any Lebanese claims. About edit warring: The edit warring article says this """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a discussion, or coerce a given stance on a page without regard to collaborative approaches"""" and also, """"Typically a user who edit wars is ignoring editorial norms, reverting rather than taking due consideration of the points made by others."""" But it also says: """"It states that a user who makes more than three revert actions (of any kind) on any one page within a 24 hour period, may be considered to be edit warring, and blocked appropriately, usually for a 24 hour period for a first incident"""".
Now there was no edit war going on, on the article in question.

As you can see, my first edit was at  00:27, 31 August 2009 which was when I added the note. The edit right after that, was me, improving the note I had added. Right after this second edit, Rlevse reverts my edits. After he does so, I revert his revert and ask that he keep it the way it is while the topic is in discussion. That was it. There was no edit war. 4 Reverts = an Edit war. That was only 1! And even if you wish to count all the edits, that was only 3 and not 4!

 Inherent Understanding and Adaptability 

In this interview with Bryan Fuller (Already cited on Sylar's page), he says that Sylar's power is an """"inherent understing and adaptability"""", and he  was able to use his powers in the cell to kill Eden because he was """"playing possum"""". (The Sylar part of the interview starts at about the 42 minute mark). Given that description, I think that his original ability is comprised of two seperate comic-book superpowers:

Superhuman Intelligence - Sylar has inherent understanding of how things work.
Reactive adaption/Evolution - Sylar can adapt his own body to various conditions. It's on a much more subtle scale then in comic books, granted, but it's pretty close.

 Potsdam Declaration 

Here some quotation from the """"Official Gazette of the control council for Germany"""" (Documents relating to the establishment of the Allied Control Authority) - published by the """"Allied Secretariat"""" in Berlin, Elssholzstrase 32.

Under item VI (Statement by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic and the Provisional Government of the French Republic on the zones of occupation in Germany) they write:

""""1. Germany, within her frontiers as they were on 31st December, 1937, will, for purposes of occupation, be divided into four zones, one to be alloted to each Power as follows ...""""

Under item  VIII (Report on the Tripartite Conference of Berlin) and there Article IX concerning the western frontier of Poland they write:

""""The three Heads of Government reaffirm their opinion that the final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement.""""

Until this peace conference the disputed territories """"shall be under the administration of the Polish State and for such purposes should not be considered as part of the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany.""""

So keeping in mind this facts sincerely it´s obvious that the (West-) Allies didn´t order any transfer of Germans out of their ancestral homelands because by doing this they would have created a fait accompli. 

Actually Russia and Poland created such accomplished facts by expelling most of that Germans - even quite long before the Potsdam Declaration. 

(Comment: Any forced transfer of population is a crime against humanity; and this it was already at times of 1945 - Nazi-Germany was trialed exactly for such crimes, too.)

Why was the below article redirected to ET? I thought it was setup for a vote and nothing was finalised?

Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity

EBE is an abbreviation for the term Extra Terrestrial Biological Entity.

In the 1940's several alien spacecraft were allegedly recovered by the U.S. and other countries, along with a few dead aliens and one live one. These beings were referred to as EBEs (a name suggested by Dr. Vannevar Bush).

The term was first made reference to in 1986 when Jenny Randles interviewed a military soldier named """"Robert"""" about some stolen Top Secret US Military papers. The term was first made public in 1987 with the release of the Majestic 12 documents by Timothy Good (a)(b):

""""Dr. Detlev Wulf Bronk's team has suggested the term """"Extra Terrestrial Biological Entities"""" (EBEs), be adopted as the standard term of reference for these creatures until such time as a more definitive designation can be agreed upon.""""  (b)

In a letter to researcher William Steinman, Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher who was with the Washington Institute of Technology, confirms that some of the scientists involved in the study of recovered flying discs from Roswell were Dr. Vannever Bush, John von Neumann, and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. (c) Steinman also discovered that one of the scientists working on saucer technology from the early days was Dr. Eric Henry Wang who became Director of the Department of Special Studies, within the Structures Division, of the old Wright Air Development Center, near Dayton, Ohio. 

This term has been often used in the TV series X-files.

 Confused about how members are selected 

I'm a bit confused how the members are selected. I know each has to be approved individually, but how exactly are they nominated (self nominated?)? Are only the appropriate number for each region nominated or is it possible to have more then the total allowed for a region nominated? If it's possible to have more then the total, and more then the total are approved, how exactly are the states which will actually be on the council selected (e.g. based on the votes received). Finally, whatever the case, what happens if not enough states are selected/approved from a region?  

I hink that they are self-nominated because there were more candidates then mandates to disperse.  

To address your questions in order:
They are all self-nominated. The countries have to volunteer, and they have to invite observers into their countries to check how their own human rights record actually is.
It is possible, and intended, that more than the alotted number of slots nominate themselves; else, why vote if we have exactly as many candidates as slots?
As has happened for the Western European and Others Group, the ones with the most votes in support are selected. (None of the candidates from the WEaOG got less than 50% approval, but Greece and Portugal got the smalles number of votes, I believe.)

Hello Tobias,
Thought you'd like to know I've recently concluded a useful email correspondence with a member of staff at the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). In short, it appears the NGA uses a four to five level system not unlike NUTS+LAU; I've transcribed it from the table sent by email into the wikitable below:

 Feature Designation Code  Name                                  Text ADM1  first-order administrative division   a primary administrative division of a country, such as a state in the United States ADM2  second-order administrative division  a subdivision of a first-order administrative division ADM3  third-order administrative division   a subdivision of a second-order administrative division ADM4  fourth-order administrative division  a subdivision of a third-order administrative division ADMD  administrative division               an administrative division of a country, undifferentiated as to administrative level

The NGA leaves the definitions (""""Text"""" in the above table) of ADMs 2-4 """"intentionally vague... All we attempt to identify with the ADM is the hierarchical structure, and if there is no hierarchy, then the level of importance or size (with ADM1 being the largest).""""

Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies.""""

The Roman Catholic Church was the dominating religion until the Revolution of 1789, when the revolutionaries sought to overthrow not only the monarchy and its supporters, but also the whole social and political system, including the Church. Although the Church survived the revolution, according to the ideology of the new republic it could no longer remain a separate estate with its own possessions. Therefore, the new government confiscated the land and assets belonging to the Church and auctioned them off to help resolve the financial problems that had led to the revolution. The state also attempted a huge restructuring of the Church hierarchy and demanded that the clergy swear allegiance to the French government ahead of the Church. Only a small percentage of priests complied with this request, but nevertheless this attempt to bring the Catholic Church under state control can be seen as the beginning of the development of secularism in France.

As a description of the events of 1790, this lacks both neutrality and accuracy.

Sphinx Facing Leo vs Orion Rising - Witness to God

The real reason for the Sphinx is that at the top of Orion , above the shoulders is a faint face , the very same face as the face of the Sphinx, and additionally, this face did formally, paint the side of the great pyramid to shows its clear outline and facial details , which are the same as the face of the Sphinx (before the local massive desecration by the Muslims who defaced all 3 pyramids by removing the outer very polished face of all 3 pyramids). And that face there at top of Orion and the same face as the Sphinx, IS the face of Allah/God there for all to see and there projecting on the side of the great pyramid, before that gigantic desecration of Allah by Muslims.

In addition, this alignment at the time of ORION RISING (at sunrise) ALSO predicts the time of the coming of Allah/ God / Jesus (about NOW) the reason for the alignment. AND HOW could the builders of the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids know all this, by revelations from God/Allah, and NOT ALIENS flying about to TEACH THEM.

This face is also more universal than even this, as the Srinagar, India Buddha, on side of small hill in India has the very same face (instead of the usual, many generic stylized normal Buddha faces) and this particular Buddha is thought to be Maitreya , which is the Buddhist version of Jesus Second Coming.... And on and on.... Now Look Up & SEE ,

f.n. and that face of the Sphinx (heavily damaged by mainly those firing rifles at it again in huge desecration) but STILL visible adequately to anyone giving a little thought to it ,,,, is ALSO the 'pillar at the border of Egypt , a witness to GOD/Lord (not a witness to you but a witness to God himself, who is ALLAH as there is ONLY ONE GOD) as it IS HIS FACE, see Isaiah 19: 19 - """"In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD."""" please add above to 'correct' whole article thanks 47.18.43.166 (talk) C, MP

f.n. this section was removed by occasional admin Doug Wells claiming it was making this discussion a forum ... all silliiness which one gets endlessly from Wells, when the above (and below) is adding exact facts directly pertinent to the ongoing subject, discussion....

 Addditionally, the Pleiades constellation has the very same face there for all to see, and is the reason for alignment of many ancient temples with the Pleiades as their 'presentment' or back temple walls so aligned to SHOW ALSO (as the side of the great pyramid, that same face of God/Allah at certain times of the year .... ref also Lauscau cave apse alignments ... add'l note for the Doublas Wells, can you ever allow adding normal facts as these, without obstructing the very point of Wikipedia to have articles discussing the facts pertinent and involved in the relevant article, without defacing endlessly the very discussion with drivel claims ... thanks curator astral record sr ... 47.18.43.166  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make. BOTH sides of the murder mystery need to be included but since you have blocked both editors on the same side and encouraged the others to remove ALL of our work, it will hardly be a surprise when this article reads like the prosecutor's brief. But to me the worst part is to see the condoning of abuse of a woman editor. That is so sickening it is beyond what I am willing to tolerate, even to try to help achieve NPOV in an article.

Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things? No.  You fucked up.

The 'gender gap' will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on. The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people. The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women, such as ill-conceived politeness, will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done. ~~~~",1,0,1,0,0,0

228d91c0ca07e17a,"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!! They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen. Fuck you EU government dickheads, we ESL teachers all hate you!!!!!!!  You ruined our jobs, our profession.

Your donation will fund Wikia, Inc., which is not a charity. Your non-profit donation will ultimately line the for-profit pockets of Jimmy Wales, Amazon, Google, the Bessemer Partners, and other corporate beneficiaries. How? Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise  there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc. Its co-founder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine! 

Now here is the really fascinating thing. If you go to Jimmy Wales' """"talk page"""" on Wikipedia, and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his for-profit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or self-dealing, Jimbo won't even have time to respond. One or two of his sycophants will fairly promptly dismiss or erase your message; and if you try one more time to ask this question, you're likely to get blocked from editing Wikipedia altogether.

You are the most disgusting fat, worthless piece of crap to ever grace wikipedia. Losers who still live with their parents, work in walmart and pretend to be an anarchist are worthless swine with nothing relevent to add to an encyclopedia. Please leave this place, you pathetic drag on humanity. You make me sick, you pathetic cretin. I hope you feel nothing but unhappiness for the end of your days, fool. I hope you suffer in your inequity, weighed down by your massive manbreasts, making women point at you and laugh in the street and making men thank god they aren't as ugly as you. You look like a paedophile, and probably are, children in the street run into their houses when they see your approach: A truly vile beast of a man, with no intellect, no integrity, no idea of how pathetic he is, you maintain a website and believe this is virtuous - what a waste of human thought you truly are. A curse on humanity is what you are, and the sooner wikipedia is without you the better for all. I beseech you, please leave this place and never come back - turn your back on civilised society and take to the wild - maybe there you shall find some solace. Even in the very wilds of the planet there are animals who will appreciate you for what you are, if you are capable of a modicum of kindness. Please consider this, for you are a drag on humanity.",1,0,1,0,1,0

Paul Tibbit is a fucking-ass little piece of smelly donkey shit that raped SpongeBob rock-hard!!! 
I hope Paul Tibbit gets fucking cancer and burns in hell!
PAUL TIBBIT IS A WEED-SMOKING BASTARD WHO COMPLETELY FUCKED UP SPONGEBOB!!!!
SpongeBob is a pile of crap now. I don't think I've ever hated a person more than I hate Paul Tibbit. Him and his piss-poor animation skills.
Yeh Tibbit is SUCH A HOMO!!!!
I hope he fucking dies!
What the motherfucking hell is up with people these days? Nick's people obviously smoked lots and LOTS of crack in 2004!
I love Old SPongeBob. New SpongeBob. I don't blame SB. I blame FUCKING PAUL TIBBIT!!!!  SCREW YOU PAUL!!!!
Thanks to that man-hag SpongeBob is completely f++ked up. 

Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts! Like Paul Tibbit even HAS any!!!> If I ever meet Paul in real life I swear to neptune I will cut off his large, hairy ball sack tare out his skull and feast on his insides for Thanksgiving!!!!

Nick's people these days are obviously on tons of marijuana! These drunk dunces have no idea in hell what cartoon quality is ALL ABOUT! It would've been WAY better if they just slaughtered this crappy series after the movie!!!! Why watch this shit anymore when Paul Tibbit DESTROYED SPONGEBOB!!!!!! Little do I understand the appeal of the new SpongeBob. I can't believe Paul Tibbit can actually get away with screwing around with a phenominal TV show like he's on freaking cocaine or something! P. Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty. Sure there may be some people out there who like the new SpongeBob, but anyone that does may never understand the meaning of good quality. In conclusion, FUCK YOU PAUL TIBBIT!!! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!!

You are a half-turk, half-arab with no roots who can't even speak or write Persian like a native (even in short expressions it is obvious in your case) who has no real roots in Iran and all your edits have been about image and fooling yourself about your fantasy of the bogus identity that you have created for yoruself in your mind.  Nearly all your """"contributions"""" to Wikipedia have been about promoting your fake image, especially your uncultured fucking Qajar turks and your lizzard-munching arab ancestors and basically, your """"contributions"""" can be summed up as """"fake image with pretty pictures"""" (may i say that the pictures are not nearly as """"pretty"""" as you think, by the way?).  Also, your behaviour in Wikipedia clearly shows the half-Arab/half-Turkish blood.  You act exactly, 100% like a half-arab/half-turk boor, with ZERO tolerance and respect for others and ZERO sense of compromise and ZERO sign of culture or civility.  Last but not least, if you think the Khums financial aid and social programmes for the  Sayyeds is not true, and if you have even one single cell of brain in your vacuous cramium, why don't you ask yoruself then what exactly """"Sahme Sadaat"""" part of the Khums means?  Does it mean """"portion for the movie stars""""?!  You really ARE dumb, aren't you?  And if you still have doubts, since you are from a mullah, sayyed family, I am sure you know that you can write to any of the ayatollahls offices or the howza and ask them any question you want.  Simply ask them what """"Sahme Sadaat"""" portion of the Khums exactly means.

Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

Re-read the fucking link;

http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:12432

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand. HBO are a joke....whenever Jones faced his hand picked opponents defending his bogus belts on their broadcasts, hbo would even mention the legit champion - Michalczewski.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

 What 

The fuck is going on here................ I don't even know if I should bother trying to fix this or just use my second account permanently. Shit, Indrian and Times probably playing some shit game here pretending to act like me and got all this shit on my page. I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own.

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,
Michelle Rollins""",1,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Ed,

I was wondering how you feel about sharing a common ancestor with a monkey? I mean, it's really not that shocking when you think about it. Just like monkeys, humans love to eat, sleep, and mate. So I ask you Ed, are you better than a monkey? 68.203.13.249",1,0,0,0,0,0

Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force.

Maybe the people here have been too polite to tell you, but you are a complete fucking crank.

WRONG retard, The good ending is not the canon ending. Wheeler only said that no one knows what happened to Cybil. She could have simply sneaked back into town, backed up her belongings and fled town to start a new life. If you had paid attention while playing SH: Homecoming, you would have learned that Wheeler said that The Order is one to bear a grudge. They don't take kindly to people that don't share their beliefs. And they are known to have the ability to track people down. And in the translated book of memories, Silent Hill Hiroyuki Owaku stated that Cybil's fate is """"left to players' imaginations"""".

bac5d7a187cd528a,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

There you have it. Noel Malcolm is revered and aknowledged as a neutral and impartial historian. But just because he isn't on of your Serbo-bloggers, you come up with all this shit about his works. When he says """"conquered"""", that is exactly what the term means. Your map is shit. Because Serbs ONLY MADE UP 25% of that land whether it was a bigger or smaller Kosova than today. And I call it KOSOVA because KOSOVA is it's name. It's Serbo-nationalists like you, Dab, and Balkanfever who keep it in it's Milosevic devized name. And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913. Well???? What happened???? Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue. It doesn't matter if Kosova was once it Italy, I tell you that it has never been in Serbia, it only had the bad luck to be in the same """"genocide state"""" as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia.

Really guys, why are we so naive to believe that an organization of homosexual blacks or native Americans could be more notable than one of whites? There is probably even Wikipedia policy that in all cases blacks go below whites on lists.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0

It makes me so mad how people take their anti-video game sentiment to this extreme! What the heck is wrong with video games? Why are they considered a waste of time?

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient. Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

 False accusations 

Kim, you have given me inappropriate & inaccurate labels regarding the info that I have added on the Mann talk page. I did not add anything false & included a reliable source.

Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient people's may have accepted homosexuality? Why do you have to distort history to fit your image? 

first off there is no concrete evidence that alexander liked it up the butt...let's get that straight...no pun intended

second i'm sure there was gay shit back in the day, like in every culture...but i don't believe everyone was doing it....just because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay act...doesn't mean everyone back then was gay

third...there is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophile...i say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see them..that doesn't mean i want their ass...look at shaq and wade slapping each other's ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay?

fourth...just because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gay...doesn't mean they were...alot of plays (especially comedies) were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupid...like calling them gay...just look at comedies now making fun of people...someone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit, but we all know he is straight

fifth...i hate gay propaganda...i know they are people blah blah blah...but to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is pathetic...just because there are no great gay people in history doesn't mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look good....from alexander to hitler to lincoln...you guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive. Robin Lane Fox writes: """"Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain."""" [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, """"No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers."""" [17]

key words: uncertain, no historian

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh?

So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did? I do not at all think my arguments are gospel, I just proudly stand by my word until a logical argument will present a sensical contradiction. You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda. 

Please man, let's put some sense into this argument, and remove all the non-sensical bullcrap you've included into. And don't ever, EVEr fucking tell me to go away, got it?

Considering Goethean hates Roskam and his activities violates WP:COI regarding his editing on this bio (goethean's bias on Rosakam) which shows a systemic bias. But, then again no matter wikipeidia policy and ethics - only democrats, who are approved by Gothean and his master  and WP:SPA puppet  are allowed. Classic case of WP:OWN. Only DCCC point of view is approved.  
 
Lets just lose the pretense of fairness here and just consider this bio an official DCCC online version, and not any thing NPOV and far from Encyclopedic and fair.  All of which give more proof that section 230 should be revised and rewrite to make those responsible accountable.

A word to  personally, how can you have any kind an ethical religion and engage in such disingenuous and behavior, contrary to your own belief system (Hindu Buda etc.) which I see you engage in, on Wikipeida??? I wonder how you look at your self in the mirror or even sleep at night, unless you have compartmentalized your mind off so well as you can stay sane with the hypocrisy you seem to demonstrate by your own behavior? What you do and what you seem to believe in seem in conflict? 68.75.174.105

Within minutes , User:Escape Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article, without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was 'advertising' and my page was 'unambiguously promotional'. This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article.

Secondly, User:Purplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker.

It also has a racist angle. Now don't come to me and say you called him a racist. Better you check his edits. He is showing signs of dislike for a particular race, otherwise one will not try deliberately attempt to tarnish the image of one race. It's not part of ordinary edits because we don't find it with anyother countries.

I think you are high on the lies told by storm front. You the hell listens to storm front. Oh my god Wikipedia is becomeing a dumping ground for neo-nazis and altra lefties. Since I am the voice of reason. I just have to say one thing. Pleas read my reply to storm front. Here it is - Okay okay. Lats just get the fatcs right. This is what some nazi said on storm front
"""" Peter Watson (of Warwick, Qld.) has claimed to represent all sorts of groups, and - in forums - likes to pretend he is several people at the same time. He has a habit of claiming to be the President of organisations he has made up on the internet. He says he is 14 (or 16) years old.""""

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

 You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war  according to the reverts you have made on Srebrenica massacre. Users who edit disruptively or refuse to collaborate with others may be blocked if they continue. In particular the three-revert rule states that making more than three reversions on a single page within a 24-hour period is almost always grounds for an immediate block. If you find yourself in an editing dispute, use the talk page to discuss controversial changes. Work towards wording and content that gains consensus among editors. If unsuccessful, then do not edit war even if you believe you are right. Post a request for help at an appropriate noticeboard or seek dispute resolution. In some cases it may be appropriate to request temporary page protection. If edit warring continues, you may be blocked from editing without further notice. 

 Please do not attack other editors, as you did at Srebrenica massacre. Comment on content, not on contributors. Personal attacks damage the community and deter users. Please stay cool and keep this in mind while editing. Thank you.   (TALK)

Oh, and here is the response I posted, that got erased: 

REDVEЯS, I do not feel my comments are poisonous. Other people agree with me. The """"good editor"""" you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used. As far as I know, most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself. To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous. You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.
And here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe. She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her (as anyone can see in the history of her page), and it wasn't until you used intimidation (on a talk page I think, by implying she shouldn't even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked) that she immediately backed down and got friendly, clearly out of fear that you would block her. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Anonymous 374 (talk • contribs) """,1,0,0,0,0,0

 You are one of the most pathetic administrators on this site. 

This is just plain sad. I am a susbcriber to Jane's Intelligence online, and I found the article easily. (you need to be a subscriber to access it, but it is certainly not hard to find). If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book """"The Irish War"""" also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit. You are one of the worst administrator's I have ever dealt with, you are the reason academics don't respect Wikipedia. 

PS. I realize you are a Loyalist terrorist supporter, and therefore can't deal with the fact that the IRA killed a large number of UDA/UVF/LVF members...but those are the historical facts, grow up and deal with it.

Time for some words Jack the Twat
“I think you will find that this user and User:HampshireCricketFan are one and the same person”

So dickhead what evidence do you have for that remark? None whatsoever, absolutely none. Looking at the comments you leave on others User Talk pages and on other pages around this site it is clear you are one arrogant son of a bitch, completely stuck up your own arse and full of your own self importance. 

“Very surprised to see this here and I would disagree strongly with the view that this page is """"is the most comprehensive page on an English County Championship team"""". Nowhere near: see Yorkshire, for example”

What person lists an article written mostly by themselves? Right, someone of the above mentioned description - an arrogant cock.

It is funny seeing the way you comment other people, talking down to them like you being an admin is of such importance: You the fucking man... not! As if anyone gives a flying fuck. Epic fail Jack, epic fucking fail. 

“You appear to have missed the irony of my use of quotes re """"new"""" user on the ANI page... I suggest that you need to look a little deeper and trust experienced editors rather than immediately evoking sympathy for the poor """"new"""" user.”

Yet another example of your holier than thou attitude, even when people correct you your own self arrogance shows. Quite honestly Jack you are a complete twat and it really is time you stopped masturbating over your own self importance.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0
